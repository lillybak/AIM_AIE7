It also specifically notes : If the borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan becomes delinquent in making payments or defaults on the loan, we may also report your name to consumer reporting agencies in connection with the delinquent or defaulted loan. The use of the word may indicates that reporting my name for delinquencies is discretionary, not mandatory.\\n\\nIn my case, the borrower did not default on the loan ; there were only late payments due to a lack of notification during a servicer transition. I was never notified of the delinquency or given an opportunity to bring the account current before negative information was reported on my credit. Given the discretionary nature of reporting as outlined in the MPN, and the fact that I was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to address the situation, I believe it is unfair and inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement to have my credit negatively impacted under these circumstances. \\n\\nI have a strong history of on time payments, and if given the chance and proper communication, I would have kept the account status current, thus preventing any delinquency on my credit report as well as my mother 's.]</td>\n",

              "      <td>The mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of your personal information, including your Social Security number, by your student loan servicer has resulted in a serious breach of your privacy and potential long-term harm to your financial and personal security. According to your formal complaint, this breach involved violations of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and may have allowed unauthorized third parties to access or misuse your Social Security number, financial data, and educational records. This has caused you emotional distress, loss of trust, and increased vulnerability to further harm. Additionally, due to persistent issues with loan forgiveness applications, gaps in payment plans, and egregious interest accrual, you have been paying for over 20 years and now face a higher loan balance than the original amount. If you fail to pay, your Social Security payments can be garnished, which would leave you in poverty at an age when you can no longer work. To address these violations and protect your Social Security, you are formally requesting immediate discharge and withdrawal of the affected student loan, permanent removal of related loan data from credit reports, a complete audit and explanation of the data breach, and confirmation that all improperly shared records have been destroyed or secured. You are also seeking urgent review and enforcement action from the CFPB to hold the responsible parties accountable and prevent further harm.</td>\n",

This is not my fault they changed but its a contract and they need to follow it., Nelnet did not inform me of my payments needing to resume. No emails, no calls, no written correspondence. My loan is now is default and I had no information this was forthcoming, or what options I had before this transpired., The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month. I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers., My credit score recently dropped XXXX points because of a miscommunication with NelNet. The automatic payments on my loans had paused in 2020 but didn't automatically turn back on - apparently I had to manually reactivate them which I was unaware of. I believe a letter was sent out stating this but it went to an old address on file ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) so we never received it. Due to these circumstances, I was recently granted forbearance by a NelNet rep and my account is back to good standing, but my credit is still way down., The company NelNet did not have the correct contact information in regards to my federal student loans. They never mailed me a letter saying that the forbearance on the account has ended. Never mailed me a letter saying that payments on my account have started. Never mailed me to inform me that my account was delinquent. I only found out after checking my credit score and noticing a XXXX XXXX from 8 missed payments on 4 different loans XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not know my student loan payments were set to resume and they had the wrong contact information like email and phone number, but they did have the correct address. My account was than transferred to XXXX. I called NelNet to try to get the \" late payments '' removed from my account but said they could not do so. How am I suppose to make a payment to a company that I didn't even have an account set up for if they never reached out and contacted me about it?, Nelnet can not why my balance is increasing while in forbearance. Or at least I think their incorrect and blowing me off. First I was told my balance was increasing due to interest. I questioned how its increasing due to interest while my account is in forbearance period. The next response was my account is ineligible for forbearance over a period therefore I received interest charges. \\nIn XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating my account was going into forbearance and would be at a 0 % interest. \\nAt this point I dont trust anything in regards to my loans and would like supporting documents to confirm everything along with a credit for fraudulent charges., I don't believe I was adequately informed about my student loan delinquency. I recieved 3 calls from nelnet between XXXX &amp; XXXX. No physical mail, no emails, no voicemails. I was unaware of exactly when my loan repayment was to resume. The representative I spoke to from Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX ) had informed me that I was delinquent 140+ days, but that doesn't make sense. That means I was supposed to start repaying in XX/XX/XXXX, but before my loan switched over from great lakes to Nelnet, It said that I did not have to pay until sometime XXXX. As a result of this, my credit score dropped 165 points. This is after 10 years of credit history never missing a payment. Something must be done about this. I know there are 1000 's of other postgrad students in the same situation as me. Thank you., I spoke to their agent named XXXX on XXXX XXXX. He confirmed Nelnet did not notify me of the status of the account while the account changed from SAVE PLAN to forbearance and he put a complaint/note on the system that Nelnet must remove the interest accrued while they failed to notify me of my account status. \\n\\nHe also wrote a comment for Nelnet to place my account back on SAVE PLAN. \\n\\nHe also acknowledged the ongoing issue with loans placed by XXXXXXXX XXXX while I wasnt their student., When my federal student loans were transferred to Nelnet, Servicer to Federal Student Aid, in XX/XX/XXXX, I enrolled in AutoPay with a scheduled monthly payment of {$190.00}. Since that time, my AutoPay was unexpectedly placed into forbearance without my initiation or consent around XX/XX/XXXX. Most recently, in XX/XX/XXXX, my AutoPay amount was changed to {$150.00}, again, without any prior notification or approval from me. \\nWhen I contacted Nelnet 's customer service, I was not given a clear explanation for these changes. I requested a written explanation for the adjustment, but was informed that this was not something they could provide. \\nI am deeply concerned by these unauthorized modifications. If I had not been closely monitoring my account, I might not have noticed these changes. Reducing my AutoPay amount without consent could potentially extend the term of my loan and increase the total interest I pay over time, which feels misleading and unfair.\\n\\nI would appreciate a formal, written explanation of why these changes occurred and what steps are being taken at the Bureau level to monitor Nelnet to ensure this does not happen again without my consent., I just called Nelnet at XXXX pm on XX/XX/year&gt; to ask regarding deferment vs forbearance options, the agent puts the phone on hold and was unable to respond to my request.]</td>\n",

I called them right away made a XXXX dollar payment on the XX/XX/XXXX and then they reported me as XXXX days late after I paid. Also they said they would make it current and they would send an email that XXXX that I could send to the credit reports. Never received it. Also they marked my credit report XXXX more days late every XXXX  days. Now the good credit I had dropped to poor and fair. Now a credit card I had for XXXX years with no late payments just cancelled my credit due to this. This is not good business or the right way to do it. They also showed my payment for the previous month like XXXX dollars yet a month later I had to pay XXXX which I did because I did not want my credit wrecked., I am currently a full-time student at a medical school. I have never taken any leave of absence and I have ALWAYS been full-time. I started to receive emails from XXXX that I had a payment due. When I finally checked my account, I was delinquent for a payment. I have currently have three loans, all from the same school, and only one says \" Repayment due '' while the other two say \" In school. '' This is clearly wrong. Why is only one loan marked as \" repayment '' while the other two clearly show that I am \" in school ''??\\n\\nThe first time I called, the customer representative said she verified that I was a full-time student and would put a request to change my loan status.\\n\\nThe status was never changed. Today I called, approximately two weeks after the first call, and the customer service representative this time said I was not a full-time student. This does not make any sense since it is within the SAME semester. \\n\\nI am BEYOND frustrated with this loan servicer. They are not giving me accurate information and not fixing my problem! I can NOT make payments as I AM a full-time student and I need my loan status fixed ASAP., The company NelNet did not have the correct contact information in regards to my federal student loans. They never mailed me a letter saying that the forbearance on the account has ended. Never mailed me a letter saying that payments on my account have started. Never mailed me to inform me that my account was delinquent.

How am I suppose to make a payment to a company that I didn't even have an account set up for if they never reached out and contacted me about it?, I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?, Trying to relieve my father 's financial burden, I linked my bank account to pay the Parent Plus loans that were under his name. On XX/XX/XXXX, my father, the borrower of a Parent PLUS loan for my college education, passed away. The loan, managed by Nelnet, was eligible for discharge upon his death, per federal student loan rules. His death certificate was sent to the company after grieving, however there was a problem with the discharge that I was not made aware of. Automatic payments continued to be withdrawn from my personal bank account, which I had linked to the loan years earlier to help my father with payments, and I didn't notice them amongst the other student loan payments that were under my name. Between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I paid a total of {$9100.00} on the loan, despite it being dischargeable.\\n\\nI have screenshots of the withdrawals from my bank account and the servicers receipts confirming these payments, which I can provide. The loan was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX, but the servicer did not refund the payments I made after my fathers death. I contacted Nelnet multiple times to remedy this. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund of the {$9100.00}, explaining that I paid from my account unknowingly on a discharged loan. They denied my request to refund the bank account being drawn from because they said it had to be sent to the estate despite the funds not being drawn from my late father 's estate. They sent a check which can not be cashed, but this is not a sufficient solution.\\n\\nThese payments were not my legal obligation, as I was not the borrower, and my fathers estate is closed with no assets. The {$9100.00} overpayment has caused me financial strain. I request that Nelnet refund me the full amount, supported by my evidence of payments made after XX/XX/XXXX. Please help assist me in resolving this issue promptly., I originally was given loans by XXXX XXXX which became Navient, and I was making payments for a while then I was struggling to make payments &amp; asked to have them lowered by Navient and they just said to go on forbearance and kept putting me on forbearance it was long term. My loan is from over 20 years ago I am XXXX and haven't worked in many, many years. I am a XXXX XXXX and my husband, and I filed bankruptcy a year ago. \\nNow XXXX XXXX  has purchased the loan from Navient, and they are going after me for repayment I know my loan was mismanaged and I was constantly put-on long-term forbearance. I am struggling and we pay high rent and do not own anything, and I feel I should not be responsible for this mismanaged loan from many years ago. \\nWhat can be done., Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \\n\\nWhat Happened? \\nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \\n\\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \\n\\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year&gt;, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \\n\\nI received no response. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \\n\\nIt is now XX/XX/year&gt; over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \\n\\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \\n\\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \\n\\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \\n\\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \\n\\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \\n\\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness., I am filing a formal complaint against Nelnet regarding improper interest accrual and mismanagement of my student loan account during and after my enrollment in the SAVE repayment plan.\\n\\nBefore consolidating my loans, I had a principal balance of {$260000.00} and {$20000.00} in accrued interest. That interest was capitalized and added to the principal during consolidation, raising my balance significantly. I was never clearly informed that this would occur.\\n\\nDuring the lengthy processing period of my consolidation application, an additional {$5500.00} in interest accrued by the time I was placed in the SAVE program. I did not receive proper disclosure that interest would accumulate during this time. I called several times, and multiple representatives apologized for the misinformation. This is in the call logs. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/year&gt;, I submitted my IDR recertification. Shortly after, I received a letter from Nelnet stating that my loans would be placed in forbearance and would not accrue interest during this time. Despite this assurance, my interest has now ballooned to over {$9000.00}. This contradicts Nelnets written communication and represents a misrepresentation of loan servicing terms.\\n\\nI have attempted to resolve this directly with Nelnet, but I continue to receive inconsistent responses, no clear accountability, and no correction of the errors., I started paying back on my student loan back in XXXX, when XXXX was servicing it XXXX sold it to Navient after a few years and they have been servicing the loan until late XXXX. Based on how it was structured I wont have this paid off until I reach XXXX XXXX XXXX. I tried working with Navient in XXXX to get the loan forgiven since Ive been paying on it since XXXX. I had 4 to 5 years of forbearance due to recession and unemployment. In late XXXX  I found out that there was a class action lawsuit against Navient for illegal practices but I was never notified of this. Navient sold my loan to XXXX after the settlement was reached without my knowledge or consent, I am looking to get this loan disputed and forgiven. I originally borrowed about {$84000.00} and as of today, XX/XX/XXXX, the remaining principle on that loan is still at {$75000.00}. I have been making payments for approximately 17 years and still owe XXXX % of the principal! I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and can not retire with this loan over my head. Ive paid my debt but because of how Navient had structured the loan, almost all those payments went to interest and not principal and they refused to work with me on it.]</td>\n",

However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \\n\\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due.

This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \\n\\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \\nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \\nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \\nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \\nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \\nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \\n\\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \\n\\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \\nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \\nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \\n\\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter.

I did not have familial financial support, and without a degree, I would never have had access to a job that could support repayment or my family entirely. \\n\\nHowever, many of us who have tried to do everything right now find ourselves in crisis. The system, as it stands, is failing the very people it was meant to empower, hardworking individuals striving to better themselves and contribute meaningfully to our country. We need help. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX Additional information for the incorrect &amp; inconsistency in the reporting process that was misleading to all borrowers ( attached document )., My school loan was in forbearance well apparently forbearance ended and I did not know until I opened my credit report and saw it at XXXX days late. I called them right away made a XXXX dollar payment on the XX/XX/XXXX and then they reported me as XXXX days late after I paid. Also they said they would make it current and they would send an email that XXXX that I could send to the credit reports. Never received it. Also they marked my credit report XXXX more days late every XXXX  days. Now the good credit I had dropped to poor and fair. Now a credit card I had for XXXX years with no late payments just cancelled my credit due to this. This is not good business or the right way to do it. They also showed my payment for the previous month like XXXX dollars yet a month later I had to pay XXXX which I did because I did not want my credit wrecked., I am currently a full-time student at a medical school. I have never taken any leave of absence and I have ALWAYS been full-time. I started to receive emails from XXXX that I had a payment due. When I finally checked my account, I was delinquent for a payment. I have currently have three loans, all from the same school, and only one says \" Repayment due '' while the other two say \" In school. '' This is clearly wrong. Why is only one loan marked as \" repayment '' while the other two clearly show that I am \" in school ''??\\n\\nThe first time I called, the customer representative said she verified that I was a full-time student and would put a request to change my loan status.\\n\\nThe status was never changed. Today I called, approximately two weeks after the first call, and the customer service representative this time said I was not a full-time student. This does not make any sense since it is within the SAME semester. \\n\\nI am BEYOND frustrated with this loan servicer. They are not giving me accurate information and not fixing my problem! I can NOT make payments as I AM a full-time student and I need my loan status fixed ASAP., I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?, I am filing a complaint regarding improper handling of my federal student loans by Nelnet, particularly related to lack of required notification and premature delinquency reporting. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, Nelnet sent me a letter through their portal stating that my federal loans with 0 % interest were paused as of XX/XX/XXXX, through when the payment pause would end, under COVID-19 relief measures and explicitly said : We will notify you in advance of when these relief measures will end. However, I never received any communication from Nelnet notifying me that repayment was restarting, or when my first bill would be due. \\n\\nThe first indication I received that my loans had entered repayment came in a letter from their portal dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating I was already 15 days past due. I received another notice from their portal on XX/XX/XXXX with the same message, stating that I was again 15 days past due. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from their portal saying I was 45 days past due. Again, none of these letters came with prior billing statements or warnings about due dates. I never received a statement showing a payment schedule, amount due, or that the CARES Act pause had officially ended. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score dropped XXXX  XXXX  due to Nelnet reporting my loans as 90120 days past due. These delinquencies were reported without ever having given me proper notice that repayment had resumed, contrary to their own written commitment on XX/XX/XXXX and to Department of Education guidelines. \\n\\nI am requesting that the CFPB investigate Nelnet for failure to : -Properly notify me that my loans were exiting forbearance and entering repayment -Provide billing statements or reminders prior to delinquency -Accurately report delinquencies in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Trying to relieve my father 's financial burden, I linked my bank account to pay the Parent Plus loans that were under his name. On XX/XX/XXXX, my father, the borrower of a Parent PLUS loan for my college education, passed away. The loan, managed by Nelnet, was eligible for discharge upon his death, per federal student loan rules. His death certificate was sent to the company after grieving, however there was a problem with the discharge that I was not made aware of. Automatic payments continued to be withdrawn from my personal bank account, which I had linked to the loan years earlier to help my father with payments, and I didn't notice them amongst the other student loan payments that were under my name. Between XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I paid a total of {$9100.00} on the loan, despite it being dischargeable.\\n\\nI have screenshots of the withdrawals from my bank account and the servicers receipts confirming these payments, which I can provide. The loan was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX, but the servicer did not refund the payments I made after my fathers death. I contacted Nelnet multiple times to remedy this. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund of the {$9100.00}, explaining that I paid from my account unknowingly on a discharged loan. They denied my request to refund the bank account being drawn from because they said it had to be sent to the estate despite the funds not being drawn from my late father 's estate. They sent a check which can not be cashed, but this is not a sufficient solution.\\n\\nThese payments were not my legal obligation, as I was not the borrower, and my fathers estate is closed with no assets. The {$9100.00} overpayment has caused me financial strain. I request that Nelnet refund me the full amount, supported by my evidence of payments made after XX/XX/XXXX. Please help assist me in resolving this issue promptly., I originally was given loans by XXXX XXXX which became Navient, and I was making payments for a while then I was struggling to make payments &amp; asked to have them lowered by Navient and they just said to go on forbearance and kept putting me on forbearance it was long term. My loan is from over 20 years ago I am XXXX and haven't worked in many, many years. I am a XXXX XXXX and my husband, and I filed bankruptcy a year ago. \\nNow XXXX XXXX  has purchased the loan from Navient, and they are going after me for repayment I know my loan was mismanaged and I was constantly put-on long-term forbearance. I am struggling and we pay high rent and do not own anything, and I feel I should not be responsible for this mismanaged loan from many years ago. \\nWhat can be done., I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \\n\\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \\nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \\nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \\nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \\nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \\nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \\n\\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \\n\\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \\nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \\nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \\n\\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, Issue Summary : Servicing failure by Maximus Education XXXX ( XXXX Aidvantage ) led to derogatory credit reporting without borrower notification or account access. Despite full repayment and escalation, Ive received no resolution. \\n\\nWhat Happened? \\nAidvantage reported a late payment to the credit bureaus on a XXXX  student loan in my name, even though I, the legal borrower, was never contacted, never granted account access, and never notified of resumed repayment or delinquency. \\n\\nI discovered this only after seeing a XXXX point drop in my credit score, which severely impacted my ability to access business credit. Upon discovery, I immediately : -Paid the loan in full -Updated all contact information -Registered for account access ( for the XXXX  time ever ) -Submitted a formal goodwill adjustment request outlining the servicing failures Aidvantage ignored the core facts, sent XXXX canned responses, and never produced any evidence of contacting me, the borrower. Their only defense was that messages were posted to my \" inbox, '' a portal I couldnt access because I was never given login credentials or account info. \\n\\nServicing Failures ( All Documented ) : -No repayment notice after COVID forbearance ended ( a requirement under federal loan guidelines ) -No billing statements, emails, or delinquency alerts sent to me, only to my parents, despite being the borrower -No opportunity to cure the alleged delinquency prior to credit reporting ( a possible FCRA violation ) -No login credentials or account access ever provided, I could not monitor or pay this account until after the derogatory mark was made -No evidence ever provided by Aidvantage that communication attempts were made to me Federal Oversight Failure : On XX/XX/year&gt;, I submitted a detailed complaint to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group . Their auto-reply promised a response within XXXX days. \\n\\nI received no response. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I submitted a second follow-up directly through the XXXX platform. \\n\\nIt is now XX/XX/year&gt; over XXXX days later and the case is still marked \" In Review '' with no reply. This government silence has left me with no further path to resolution except for this CFPB filing. \\n\\nRequested Resolution : I am respectfully asking the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to : -Investigate Aidvantages failure to provide borrower-level communication or account access -Support my request for a Goodwill Adjustment and removal of the derogatory mark from all major credit bureaus -Review the breakdown in oversight and responsiveness from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Ombudsman Group Why This Matters : XXXXI have made every effort in good faith to resolve this without escalation. \\n\\nXXXXThe loan was relatively small and has been fully repaid. \\n\\nXXXXThe derogatory mark was caused solely by servicer negligence, not borrower behavior. \\n\\nXXXXThe late mark caused a XXXX point drop in my XXXX score, destroying XXXX years of perfect credit history. \\n\\nXXXXThis has directly damaged my small business, which depends on access to credit. \\n\\nXXXXI am not seeking to avoid responsibility only fairness., I am filing a formal complaint against Nelnet regarding improper interest accrual and mismanagement of my student loan account during and after my enrollment in the SAVE repayment plan.\\n\\nBefore consolidating my loans, I had a principal balance of {$260000.00} and {$20000.00} in accrued interest. That interest was capitalized and added to the principal during consolidation, raising my balance significantly. I was never clearly informed that this would occur.\\n\\nDuring the lengthy processing period of my consolidation application, an additional {$5500.00} in interest accrued by the time I was placed in the SAVE program. I did not receive proper disclosure that interest would accumulate during this time. I called several times, and multiple representatives apologized for the misinformation. This is in the call logs. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/year&gt;, I submitted my IDR recertification. Shortly after, I received a letter from Nelnet stating that my loans would be placed in forbearance and would not accrue interest during this time. Despite this assurance, my interest has now ballooned to over {$9000.00}. This contradicts Nelnets written communication and represents a misrepresentation of loan servicing terms.\\n\\nI have attempted to resolve this directly with Nelnet, but I continue to receive inconsistent responses, no clear accountability, and no correction of the errors., I started paying back on my student loan back in XXXX, when XXXX was servicing it XXXX sold it to Navient after a few years and they have been servicing the loan until late XXXX. Based on how it was structured I wont have this paid off until I reach XXXX XXXX XXXX. I tried working with Navient in XXXX to get the loan forgiven since Ive been paying on it since XXXX. I had 4 to 5 years of forbearance due to recession and unemployment. In late XXXX  I found out that there was a class action lawsuit against Navient for illegal practices but I was never notified of this. Navient sold my loan to XXXX after the settlement was reached without my knowledge or consent, I am looking to get this loan disputed and forgiven. I originally borrowed about {$84000.00} and as of today, XX/XX/XXXX, the remaining principle on that loan is still at {$75000.00}. I have been making payments for approximately 17 years and still owe XXXX % of the principal! I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and can not retire with this loan over my head. Ive paid my debt but because of how Navient had structured the loan, almost all those payments went to interest and not principal and they refused to work with me on it.]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month., I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers., According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year&gt;, but nothing else. If i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue., On XX/XX/XXXX I submit another payment through the NelNet site for {$1500.00} to cover the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX payments. Again the payment showed as processed then I received a notice the payment was no processed again a few days later. I called NelNet and the representative said the receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX reject the payment. Again this is the same account I've used for years to make these payments. I called XXXX and they have no record of payments attempted and confirmed the account is in good status with sufficient funds. I asked NelNet to reprocess the payment on the phone and to back date the payment to the original date it was processed to avoid the extra interest accrued and they said they would not do it. They instructed me to delete my auto pay, do a one-time payment, then reset my auto pay, which I am in the process of completing., Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., XX/XX/XXXX I increased the amount to automatically be paid each month from {$790.00} to {$850.00}. The payment showed as paid on the student loan provider ( NelNet ) as of XX/XX/XXXX, but did not clear my XXXXXXXX XXXX account. It is the same bank account I've had associated with the auto debit for years. A few days later I received a notice the payment never went through., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. You have been formally notified., XXXX now has my loan transferred from Navient. XXXX is missing {$26000.00} in payments I made to Navient. Navient can only refer me to XXXX and claims they have no records of my payments., I keep setting up auto-debit with NelNet, get confirmation, and then the payments aren't processing. In XXXX of XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX I tried to set up auto debit for my loan. I go back in and the website shows I didn't make a payment. I have received multiple confirmations that I have been set up for auto-debit and then NelNet deletes the record. I have a paper letter confirming auto-payment enrollment from XX/XX/XXXX, but the website keeps deleting my payment data., This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act.

I've checked several times with my bank, and they disagree ; they say the problem is AidVantage.

I formally entered the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. My loan was then transferred from XXXX to AidVantage on XX/XX/XXXX. Even if the ending accrued interest amount was correct leaving XXXX ( which I would like to verified as I believe it is incorrect ), the amount of accrued interest that appeared in AidVantage after the transfer was different ( and higher ) then what was last documented in XXXX. I believe there was an error that occurred in the transfer process, and erroneous interest was added. The amount of accrued interest on my current AidVantage account is different then when it entered ( again, on SAVE plan so there should be no additional interest ). AidVantage is also charging me erroneous interest.

Upon receiving that alarming alert I immediately went into my account to investigate on what company could possibly state that I have missed three payments. When I opened the file I saw that it was it was Aid Vantage the new servicer that has taken over XXXX accounts which was my formeXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXervicer. On XX/XX/scrub&gt; 2025 I contacted Aidvantage to inquire about the account they have and I was informed that the contact information they had on file was all they had and unfortunately for myself all my contact information that was forwarded to them by XXXX was out dated. I proceeded updated my information and request to have them send me the documentation needed to apply for a forbearance. which was sent to me on XX/XX/year&gt;2025. It is so unfair for the agency that has taken over these accounts report you to the credit bureau without exhausting option to contact to to avoid a negative to your credit report. It is so hearting breaking and this could have been avoided., BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \\nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \\nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \\nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \\nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \\nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\\n\\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again., Aidvantage - XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I went and created the log in to the Aidvantage website and paid them and hit the autopay button. Apparently, it was not turned on, and Aidvantage didn't notify me. They had my phone number but claimed they used the other number on the account, which had not been my number since XXXX and they were notified of this. The where paid in XX/XX/XXXX and went in notified XXXX of nonpayment in XX/XX/XXXX, again not notifying me or giving me the 90 grace period that they allow according to their web site. When I found out that they had not turned auto pay on, I immediately paid the account for the amount due and turned auto pay on, again it didnt turn on. I waited until the bill posted and again turned on auto pay. Again it didnt activate even though the site said auto pay to my checking account that they had on flie. I literally watched my account go from delinquent to good standing to turn on auto pay to delinquant in a seven hour period in the same day last week. I again called them the next day and paid an additonal amount and asked for auto-pay to be turned back on, the company could not tell me wither the auto-pay was actually turned on and told me to check back in on them in 10 days. when I called the call center to complain, I spoke to a supervisor that told me that Aidvantage would provide a letter to the credit agency and then later the same day I was told that they would not. I have been hung up on 3 times by their customer service group as well as never connected to a manager when requesting this and left on hold for over 3 hours.\\n\\nThey need to provide the letter of correction that they have promised. they also need to report the account as being paid, this has been going on for weeks and the credit agencies still see the account as not paid!!!, Ive been on an IDR plan since XXXX, made 123+ qualifying payments, and was on track for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX.

Despite this, they refused to review my case or assist in correcting the report. They instructed me to dispute with the credit bureaus first which Ive already done. \\n\\nI am requesting that Aidvantage investigate and remove these delinquencies, as they were not due to negligence or missed payments, but reversed transactions beyond my control. I have acted in good faith at every step., I initially had XXXX as my student loan provider but decided to consolidate my loans and chose AidVantage as the provider. The loans were accepted and dispersed to AidVantage in XX/XX/year&gt; with first payment due on XX/XX/year&gt;. I set up my account and included my banking info to make electronic transfer of funds payments and made the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received notice that the payment was reversed. I logged into my AidVantage account and checked to make sure my routing and account number were correct. They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet. Im not the average student loan borrower as I am almost XXXX XXXX XXXX, but there has to be a better way to simply make a loan payment. Any assistance appreciated., I am requesting that the late payment be removed from my credit report as reported by aidVantage. I have contacted them to request they contact the credit bureaus but they have refused, ignored and been belligerent with me. They have done me serious harm for something that is entirely their fault. \\n\\nThey took my student loan from XXXX and even though XXXX had my correct, updated information, aidVantage was contacting dramatically outdated addresses, emails and I have no idea what phone number, if any, they had. \\n\\nSo I had NO idea that my previously deferred loan was with this new company, was no longer deferred, and payments were due until XXXX XXXX alerted me to a XXXX point drop in my credit. In a couple days I paid everything outstanding and brought it to date and tried to find out what happened. \\n\\n\\nIn short, aidVantage was sending mail to addresses from XXXX on XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I lived in XXXX from XXXX through XXXX which I can prove, and have lived at XXXX addresses after this. I now live at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and have for over a XXXX  months. SO none of their mail was reaching me. In the attachment you will see XXXX was sending mail to my house at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so aidVantage has no excuse to have used a XXXX XXXX XXXX address. \\n\\nI have attached proof that XXXX was mailing my current home and that any email to the address aidVantage claims they were using would have been bounced back to them- so that one they should have known was not being received. I also have attached proof that even my DL was at the address this company was using, so there is no reason for them to have using this old address.. \\n\\nNow my family could not even rent safe housing in XXXX due to to the negligence of this company. This is like the electric company sending your light bill to your neighbors and shutting of your lights when you don't pay! Now I am paying dearly for it in the form of drastically reduced credit score and will be for years to come - this is not right! \\n\\nI have attached evidence.

I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\\n\\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \\n\\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \\n\\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\\n\\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments., I was approved for an Income Driven Repayment Plan on XXXX/25. It was emailed to my inbox and it is also able to be verified on XXXX XXXX. My lender Aidvantage has yet to apply the correct amount to be charged monthly which is XXXX based on my income and family size. I had to ask for a forbearance because they are continuing to charge me over XXXX a month which I can not afford. My IDR application was approved prior to The government putting a hold on processing applications. However, aidvantage is taking too long to honor my IDR payment. My forbearance ends XXXX/25 and I can not afford this payment and the loan will go into default. I have contacted aidvantage several Times and each time the representative says they see that I was approved and it should be fixed but it never is., In XX/XX/XXXX ( CFPB ID : XXXX ) I asked why my SAVE application was not processed AND/OR PLACED IN FORBEARANCE WITH NO INTEREST ACCRUAL. On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \\n\\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \\n\\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \\n\\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \\n\\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \\n\\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \\n\\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \\n\\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \\n\\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \\n\\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \\n\\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\\n\\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \\n\\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\\n\\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \\n\\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\\n\\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I am submitting this complaint regarding the federal student loan forgiveness program announced by the XXXX XXXX in XXXX \\n\\nI applied for and was approved for up to {$20000.00} in loan forgiveness. Based on official guidance and the repeated extensions of the payment pause, I was led to reasonably believe that my balance would be reduced before repayment resumed. \\n\\nFollowing this official direction, I did not make payments, as federal communication indicated no payments were necessary while forgiveness was pending. However, after the program was overturned by the Supreme Court, no alternative relief or adjustment was provided to borrowers like myself who acted in good faith based on government promises. \\n\\nAs a result, I am now considered behind on my loans, not because of negligence, but because I trusted the guidance given at the time. I feel this situation is extremely unfair and has caused me financial and emotional stress. It has been a major mental and emotional struggle to even motivate myself to repay now, because it feels fundamentally unjust to be penalized for following what the government instructed me to do. \\n\\nI respectfully request that my loan account be restored to good standing without penalties or negative credit reporting. Additionally, due to the false hope provided and the harm caused by being placed into delinquency, I am formally requesting that a meaningful percentage of my loan balance be forgiven as compensation for the damage caused. \\n\\nBorrowers who relied on government communications should not be punished. I followed all instructions provided, and I am simply asking for fair treatment based on the promises that were made. Thank you for your urgent review and assistance., I am on an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan and submitted my recertification to Aidvantage. My application is marked as processing, but I was informed it can not be completed due to a court order. Despite this, my monthly payment has tripled. \\n\\nI explained to Aidvantage that the Department of Education extended IDR recertification deadlines until at least XX/XX/XXXX for all IDR plans not just SAVE and that borrowers should not be penalized while processing is delayed. They refused to adjust my payment or offer administrative forbearance. \\n\\nDuring a live chat on XX/XX/XXXX, an Aidvantage representative named XXXX made an unprofessional political comment, saying : Sorry for the inconvenience this is due to the president and his order which as we all can see is no greater than him. I found this highly inappropriate and irrelevant to my repayment issue. \\n\\nThis behavior is unacceptable from a federally contracted loan servicer, and I believe Aidvantage is failing to follow both policy and professional conduct standards.]</td>\n",

I have documentation of the following details : XXXX Account XXXX : Outstanding Accrued Interest to date, based on issued statements/date billed : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$740.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$80.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} ( how did it jump up so much compared to prior statement? ). \\no XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} ( last statement available ) Total Interest paid in XXXX to XXXX : {$1700.00} ( based on XXXX form from XXXX ) Payments made to XXXX : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$570.00} ( don't have documentation of when received ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$620.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1200.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) Total of {$2400.00} ( all made in XXXX ) Aid Vantage Account Information XX/XX/XXXX loan Transferred to AidVantage o No Interest Accruing on account since XX/XX/XXXX when established o Entering principal Balance of {$110000.00} plus {$1300.00} unpaid interest = {$110000.00} total is what is documented.. \\nCurrent accrued interest is {$1800.00} and total balance is {$110000.00} Total Interest paid in XXXX to AidVantage based on 1099-E : {$87.00} ( how is this possible if I didn't make a payment in XXXX? ). \\n\\nSummary : -last documented accrued interest at XXXX was {$1100.00} ( I dont believe this is accurate ) -documented accrued interest at AidVantage when the transfer was finalized : {$1300.00} ( why is there a difference in the transfer when Im on SAVE plan? ) -Current accrued interest on AidVantage {$1800.00} ( why has it gone up when Im on the SAVE plan? ) I have documentation of all of the above information., I requested a breakdown of my loans with each payment amount. \\n\\nThe amounts include the payment amount for each loan I have which totals 11 active loans. However, the payment on the letter I received shows that I ow {$530.00} per month and this letter was dated XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\nHowever, on my online account, its showing I owe {$770.00} per month and I received XXXX explanation why its such a huge jump. I received a paper letter with the {$530.00} effective payment amount starting XX/XX/year&gt;. While online I was sent a notification on XX/XX/XXXX with the amount of {$770.00} each month. \\n\\nThis is a HUGE discrepancy and there is XXXX explanation. I also don't understand how such a big mistake can be made and put in writing with a lower payment and then when I called Aidvantage they are telling me I have to pay the {$770.00} amount even though they themselves have XXXX explanation., I initially had XXXX as my student loan provider but decided to consolidate my loans and chose AidVantage as the provider. The loans were accepted and dispersed to AidVantage in XX/XX/year&gt; with first payment due on XX/XX/year&gt;. I set up my account and included my banking info to make electronic transfer of funds payments and made the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received notice that the payment was reversed. I logged into my AidVantage account and checked to make sure my routing and account number were correct. They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet. Im not the average student loan borrower as I am almost XXXX XXXX XXXX, but there has to be a better way to simply make a loan payment. Any assistance appreciated., I've made regular payments on my loan but they are reversed every time -- it's happened six times since XXXX XXXX. I've called AidVantage each month to try to fix the problem. \\n\\nThey only say, repeatedly, that the problem is with my bank. I've checked several times with my bank, and they disagree ; they say the problem is AidVantage. ( I haven't had this problem with any other company -- I make multiple payments online every month. ) There has also been enough money in my bank account to cover the loan payments -- I'm happy to provide that information. \\n\\nAidVantage says this is my fault, and that my bank number must be wrong. But the bank account number is correct -- and a single payment went through in XXXX XXXX. I've attached the account history. \\n\\nMeanwhile, AidVantage has filed info with the credit bureaus and my credit rating decreased XXXX points -- even though I have made a payment every single month. I see online that many other people have had this same problem. \\n\\nI've spent hours on hold with AidVantage, talking with representatives, checking with my bank, etc. It's reprehensible that this government loan company is so poorly run and harming the credit scores of people who have diligently worked to pay back their loans. \\n\\nPlease help!, BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \\nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \\nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \\nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \\nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \\nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\\n\\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again., Ive been on an IDR plan since XXXX, made 123+ qualifying payments, and was on track for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX. After submitting my IDR recertification and adding a new dependent ( XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ), I was told by Aidvantage that due to a stop work order from the Department of Education, my IDR application could not be processed. \\n\\nAs a result, I was defaulted into a XXXX Repayment Plan, which caused my payment to increase from ~ {$350.00} to $ XXXX. This plan does not qualify for forgiveness, and I am now at risk of losing progress toward cancellation, despite doing everything correctly. \\n\\nI am requesting the following : Retroactive SAVE Plan enrollment based on my application submission date Refund or suspension of excess payments taken during this delay Confirmation that my 123 qualifying payments remain on record Enforcement action if Aidvantages handling violates borrower protection guidelines, I was approved for an Income Driven Repayment Plan on XXXX/25. It was emailed to my inbox and it is also able to be verified on XXXX XXXX. My lender Aidvantage has yet to apply the correct amount to be charged monthly which is XXXX based on my income and family size. I had to ask for a forbearance because they are continuing to charge me over XXXX a month which I can not afford. My IDR application was approved prior to The government putting a hold on processing applications. However, aidvantage is taking too long to honor my IDR payment. My forbearance ends XXXX/25 and I can not afford this payment and the loan will go into default. I have contacted aidvantage several Times and each time the representative says they see that I was approved and it should be fixed but it never is., Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\\n\\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \\n\\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \\n\\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\\n\\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments., I have had loans with Aidvantage for a few years now ( est since XXXX  ) as it was sold from XXXX. I was deferred due to covid, but when I started making payments again, my balance was higher than it was when it started. I assume this was for interest. I paid my monthly payment, and my balance was not moving. It only went up every month. I couldn't for the life of me understand what was happening. \\nThe statements they have sent me only show the principal balance, not the whole balance, so this is misleading. How will I ever pay this off if I only pay their interest? There is no reason that {$0.00} should be off the principal for years and then change after that. This is absolutely ridiculous and feels like fraud., I applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \\n\\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\\n\\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \\n\\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\\n\\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\\n\\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \\nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\\n\\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!, Thank you for reviewing my concerns. I respectfully disagree with the assertion that nothing was reported late on Aidvantages end, as it disregards the core issue : incorrect and inconsistent reporting of my repayment start date. \\n\\nMy final coursework in the University XXXX  Georgia XXXX XXXX program concluded in summer XXXX, and my degree was conferred on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, Aidvantage incorrectly relied on a XX/XX/XXXX graduation date, as reported in an earlier data transfer, and initiated repayment with a due date of XXXX XXXXwithout verifying the updated NSLDS information. This misalignment led to the wrongful early start of my repayment period. \\n\\nI proactively worked with the University of Georgia to correct the record. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Senior Assistant Registrar, confirmed that UGA  manually updated the graduation date in the NSLDS Clearinghouse to reflect my summer XXXX graduation term. This means Aidvantage has access to the correct data and still failed to adjust my grace period or repayment terms accordingly. \\n\\nAidvantages statement that \" there is no negative reporting '' is misleading. While they may not have marked payments as formally delinquent, the incorrect repayment start date has affected the accounts age, status, and monthly payment history, which are critical components of credit scoring models used by mortgage underwriters, financial institutions, etc. The impact is not limited to delinquencyaccuracy matters. \\n\\nDespite calls and emails, including my direct outreach to my assigned representative, XXXX, I have not received confirmation that : Aidvantage received and processed the corrected NSLDS data ; My grace period has been properly reinstated ; My repayment start date has been realigned with the correct graduation date ; My credit file has been updated to reflect these changes. \\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers of credit information have a legal obligation to report accurate and complete information. Whether a late payment is marked or not, the inaccurate reporting of account status, timing, or terms still constitutes a violation of that obligation.]</td>\n",

The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower.

She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments., Loan servicer was changed without notice to Aidvantage from XXXX. They claimed to have sent a letter but I did not receive that notice. \\n\\nAs soon as I found out in XXXX, I logged in to set up payments. Reviewing the account, I discovered they had the wrong payment amount ( higher than previous noting i was not part of an income based program ). Digging into the issue, they had the wrong total and possibly even incorrect interest rates. \\n\\nThat same day, I made a call and asked for corrections. \\n\\nThey failed to action. \\n\\nI tried again, and was met with issues even getting them to answer their phone. \\n\\nIn XXXX, they said they had a work order in to correct. Called later to see what happened and they claimed not to have a work order on file. \\n\\nI went through several rounds of this going back and making complaints to XXXX and to the XXXX  on a couple occasions. \\n\\nThe last time I spoke to them, they indicated they would fix the account and remove the interest that accrued while dealing with the issue. \\n\\nThey never sent me notice except to check the account. But they did XXXX things. \\nXXXX they never actioned to correct the initial error or explain the issue. \\nXXXX they made several changes to my account without notice or permission XXXX the chose to only communicate through their website requiring be to log in and accept horrendously unacceptable &amp; likely illegal terms of service including personal liability prior to being able to ensure the account is correct. \\n\\nYesterday I called again to get the correction. They said \" wait time is over XXXX minutes '' and they never answered. After several minutes there was a beep and the hold music stopped. I waited in silence for several more minutes, totalling over XXXX minutes before I had to hang up and go back to work. \\n\\nThis is not the first time they failed to answer a call. \\n\\nThe loan would be fully paid if they had corrected it in XXXX. \\n\\nI have been working on this problem now for XXXX  years. \\n\\nI don't know what to do, but this organization was recommended through a XXXX search. \\n\\nHow do I get my issue corrected?, BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \\nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \\nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \\nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \\nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \\nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\\n\\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again., I am submitting a formal dispute against Aidvantage for inaccurately reporting my student loan under a name and date of birth that are not mine, in violation of federal consumer protection laws. While I did take out the loan, the account was reported using incorrect personal identifiers that do not match my legal identity. \\n\\nThis has caused significant damage to my credit, including a XXXX drop in my XXXX XXXX. After I filed my original complaint with the CFPB, Aidvantage responded by stating that they would update the information if I provided a government-issued ID. I did not provide my ID because I am not requesting a correction I am disputing the legitimacy and legality of the account as it currently exists. The loan was reported with false information from the start and must be deleted, not amended. \\n\\nFurthermore, XXXX has already removed the incorrect name and date of birth from my credit file, confirming that this data is not associated with me. Aidvantage, however, continues to report the account under those same false identifiers, demonstrating noncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which requires all consumer data to be accurate and verifiable.\\n\\nAidvantage has failed to conduct a meaningful investigation or resolve the dispute. Instead, they placed the burden on me to fix their reporting error which is not my legal obligation under the FCRA. Their failure to correct or delete this unverifiable account is causing ongoing financial harm and distress. \\n\\nI am requesting that the CFPB enforce the law and require Aidvantage to permanently delete this account from all credit reporting agencies, as it is tied to inaccurate and unverified personal information. This matter has gone unresolved for far too long, despite multiple efforts to dispute it properly., Im disputing 90-day late marks reported by Aidvantage on my federal student loans. I made multiple timely payment attempts, but the payments were reversed by my bank due to a processing issue I was unaware of. \\n\\nThe Aidvantage payment history clearly shows payments and reversals on : XX/XX/year&gt; XX/XX/year&gt; XX/XX/year&gt; I contacted Aidvantage directly and provided documentation, including a screenshot of their own payment history. Despite this, they refused to review my case or assist in correcting the report. They instructed me to dispute with the credit bureaus first which Ive already done. \\n\\nI am requesting that Aidvantage investigate and remove these delinquencies, as they were not due to negligence or missed payments, but reversed transactions beyond my control. I have acted in good faith at every step., I believe there are multiple errors in calculating my accrued interest by XXXX, my former loan servicer and AidVantage, my current loan servicer. I formally entered the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. My loan was then transferred from XXXX to AidVantage on XX/XX/XXXX. Even if the ending accrued interest amount was correct leaving XXXX ( which I would like to verified as I believe it is incorrect ), the amount of accrued interest that appeared in AidVantage after the transfer was different ( and higher ) then what was last documented in XXXX. I believe there was an error that occurred in the transfer process, and erroneous interest was added. The amount of accrued interest on my current AidVantage account is different then when it entered ( again, on SAVE plan so there should be no additional interest ). AidVantage is also charging me erroneous interest. I have documentation of the following details : XXXX Account XXXX : Outstanding Accrued Interest to date, based on issued statements/date billed : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$740.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$80.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} ( how did it jump up so much compared to prior statement? ). \\no XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} ( last statement available ) Total Interest paid in XXXX to XXXX : {$1700.00} ( based on XXXX form from XXXX ) Payments made to XXXX : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$570.00} ( don't have documentation of when received ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$620.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1200.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) Total of {$2400.00} ( all made in XXXX ) Aid Vantage Account Information XX/XX/XXXX loan Transferred to AidVantage o No Interest Accruing on account since XX/XX/XXXX when established o Entering principal Balance of {$110000.00} plus {$1300.00} unpaid interest = {$110000.00} total is what is documented.. \\nCurrent accrued interest is {$1800.00} and total balance is {$110000.00} Total Interest paid in XXXX to AidVantage based on 1099-E : {$87.00} ( how is this possible if I didn't make a payment in XXXX? ). \\n\\nSummary : -last documented accrued interest at XXXX was {$1100.00} ( I dont believe this is accurate ) -documented accrued interest at AidVantage when the transfer was finalized : {$1300.00} ( why is there a difference in the transfer when Im on SAVE plan? ) -Current accrued interest on AidVantage {$1800.00} ( why has it gone up when Im on the SAVE plan? ) I have documentation of all of the above information.]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \\n\\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \\n\\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \\n\\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \\n\\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., Ive been on an IDR plan since XXXX, made 123+ qualifying payments, and was on track for loan forgiveness in XX/XX/XXXX. After submitting my IDR recertification and adding a new dependent ( XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ), I was told by Aidvantage that due to a stop work order from the Department of Education, my IDR application could not be processed. \\n\\nAs a result, I was defaulted into a XXXX Repayment Plan, which caused my payment to increase from ~ {$350.00} to $ XXXX. This plan does not qualify for forgiveness, and I am now at risk of losing progress toward cancellation, despite doing everything correctly. \\n\\nI am requesting the following : Retroactive SAVE Plan enrollment based on my application submission date Refund or suspension of excess payments taken during this delay Confirmation that my 123 qualifying payments remain on record Enforcement action if Aidvantages handling violates borrower protection guidelines, Im disputing 90-day late marks reported by Aidvantage on my federal student loans.

I've called AidVantage each month to try to fix the problem. \\n\\nThey only say, repeatedly, that the problem is with my bank. I've checked several times with my bank, and they disagree ; they say the problem is AidVantage. ( I haven't had this problem with any other company -- I make multiple payments online every month. ) There has also been enough money in my bank account to cover the loan payments -- I'm happy to provide that information. \\n\\nAidVantage says this is my fault, and that my bank number must be wrong. But the bank account number is correct -- and a single payment went through in XXXX XXXX. I've attached the account history. \\n\\nMeanwhile, AidVantage has filed info with the credit bureaus and my credit rating decreased XXXX points -- even though I have made a payment every single month. I see online that many other people have had this same problem. \\n\\nI've spent hours on hold with AidVantage, talking with representatives, checking with my bank, etc. It's reprehensible that this government loan company is so poorly run and harming the credit scores of people who have diligently worked to pay back their loans. \\n\\nPlease help!, I believe there are multiple errors in calculating my accrued interest by XXXX, my former loan servicer and AidVantage, my current loan servicer.

The loans were accepted and dispersed to AidVantage in XX/XX/year&gt; with first payment due on XX/XX/year&gt;. I set up my account and included my banking info to make electronic transfer of funds payments and made the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX. A few days later I received notice that the payment was reversed. I logged into my AidVantage account and checked to make sure my routing and account number were correct. They were, so I attempted to make the payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. They were AidVantage system added both the XX/XX/XXXX payment and the XXXX fifth payment together, doubling the payment amount but I continued to process the payment. Again, a few days later the payment was reversed. I contacted AidVantage through the website and received the response to check to make sure the banking information I entered was correct ( which I had already done ) and to contact my bank to see if they were not accepting the transfer, which ai havent been able to do yet. Im not the average student loan borrower as I am almost XXXX XXXX XXXX, but there has to be a better way to simply make a loan payment. Any assistance appreciated., BACKGROUND My student loan was transferred to Aidvantage in 2023 and at which time it was in good standing with the previous lender. \\nThe loan was set up on automatic payment and therefore never had a need to contact the lender. \\nSITUATION When the loan was transferred to Aidvantage, I was not informed via email, physical mail, telephone, or text. \\nSince I was not aware that the loan had been transferred and I was not aware I needed to make updates to my payment method. \\nThis resulted in my loan going into automatic forbearance the entire time it has been with Aidvantage. \\nISSUE Within the last few months there was a change, and the loan went from forbearance to default and resulted in a negative impact to my credit score.\\n\\nAgain, I was not informed that this loan was delinquent and was not contacted by any creditors or given an opportunity to correct the issue before it was reported to the credit bureau ACTION TAKEN Immediately upon seeing the impact to my credit score, I was able to track down my account with Aidvantage and brought my account current I paid the outstanding balance of {$530.00} I set up a recurring payment plan of {$130.00} to prevent this issue from ever happening again., Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\\n\\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \\n\\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \\n\\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\\n\\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments., Aidvantage - XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I went and created the log in to the Aidvantage website and paid them and hit the autopay button. Apparently, it was not turned on, and Aidvantage didn't notify me. They had my phone number but claimed they used the other number on the account, which had not been my number since XXXX and they were notified of this. The where paid in XX/XX/XXXX and went in notified XXXX of nonpayment in XX/XX/XXXX, again not notifying me or giving me the 90 grace period that they allow according to their web site. When I found out that they had not turned auto pay on, I immediately paid the account for the amount due and turned auto pay on, again it didnt turn on. I waited until the bill posted and again turned on auto pay. Again it didnt activate even though the site said auto pay to my checking account that they had on flie. I literally watched my account go from delinquent to good standing to turn on auto pay to delinquant in a seven hour period in the same day last week. I again called them the next day and paid an additonal amount and asked for auto-pay to be turned back on, the company could not tell me wither the auto-pay was actually turned on and told me to check back in on them in 10 days. when I called the call center to complain, I spoke to a supervisor that told me that Aidvantage would provide a letter to the credit agency and then later the same day I was told that they would not. I have been hung up on 3 times by their customer service group as well as never connected to a manager when requesting this and left on hold for over 3 hours.\\n\\nThey need to provide the letter of correction that they have promised. they also need to report the account as being paid, this has been going on for weeks and the credit agencies still see the account as not paid!!!, I was approved for an Income Driven Repayment Plan on XXXX/25. It was emailed to my inbox and it is also able to be verified on XXXX XXXX. My lender Aidvantage has yet to apply the correct amount to be charged monthly which is XXXX based on my income and family size. I had to ask for a forbearance because they are continuing to charge me over XXXX a month which I can not afford. My IDR application was approved prior to The government putting a hold on processing applications. However, aidvantage is taking too long to honor my IDR payment. My forbearance ends XXXX/25 and I can not afford this payment and the loan will go into default. I have contacted aidvantage several Times and each time the representative says they see that I was approved and it should be fixed but it never is., Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \\n\\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \\nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \\n\\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year&gt;, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year&gt;, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year&gt;, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year&gt;. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \\n\\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \\nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \\nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries., I applied for and was officially approved under the Biden Administrations SAVE Plan a federal Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) program through Aidvantage, my servicer, as directed by the U.S. Department of Education . \\n\\nDespite following all application instructions and being granted approval, I am now unable to locate any record of that SAVE Plan approval or correspondence in my servicers system or communication history. My aid data shows Im placed in an Income-Based Repayment plan ( IBR ), which is not the same as the SAVE Plan I applied for and was approved under.\\n\\nI believe that critical communications have been either removed, withheld, or retroactively altered, and I suspect administrative interference from the Trump Administration following the transition in the presidential administration. This is not only unethical it violates borrower protections, federal transparency statutes, and my repayment rights. \\n\\nI urgently request investigation into this matter, full restoration and documentation of my original SAVE Plan approval, and accountability from Aidvantage and/or the Department of Education if records were altered or destroyed.\\n\\nProduct : Federal Student Loan Income-Driven Repayment Plan ( SAVE Plan ) and IDR Issue : Incorrect loan terms/ repayment plan provided Communication or account documentation missing Company : Aidvantage ( Dept. of Education Servicer ) What do you want the company to do to fix this problem?\\n\\nReissue and provide a dated copy of my SAVE Plan approval letter under the Biden Administration! \\nRestore my original SAVE Plan enrollment and IDR Investigate the improper data handling under the Trump Administration!\\n\\nPrevent further borrower harm due to policy interference and Trump administrative actions!, I received an alert from XXXX XXXX stating that I have an account that was 90 days past due. Upon receiving that alarming alert I immediately went into my account to investigate on what company could possibly state that I have missed three payments. When I opened the file I saw that it was it was Aid Vantage the new servicer that has taken over XXXX accounts which was my formeXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXervicer. On XX/XX/scrub&gt; 2025 I contacted Aidvantage to inquire about the account they have and I was informed that the contact information they had on file was all they had and unfortunately for myself all my contact information that was forwarded to them by XXXX was out dated. I proceeded updated my information and request to have them send me the documentation needed to apply for a forbearance. which was sent to me on XX/XX/year&gt;2025. It is so unfair for the agency that has taken over these accounts report you to the credit bureau without exhausting option to contact to to avoid a negative to your credit report. It is so hearting breaking and this could have been avoided., I am writing to formally file a complaint regarding a serious and unresolved issue with my federal student loans, which are currently serviced by Aidvantage. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;2025, I was quoted a monthly XXXX XXXX payment of $ XXXXa gross miscalculation. Based on my income and enrollment in the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Plan Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), the correct payment should be approximately {$1300.00} per month. I have contacted Aidvantage repeatedly over the past four weeks, speaking with more than five different representatives, and their staff has openly admitted this is a systemic error on their end. \\n\\nEach time I called, I was assured that the issue would be corrected by XX/XX/year&gt;2025. However, when I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, the representative I spoke with had no knowledge of any prior conversations, showed no awareness of the XX/XX/XXXX resolution deadline, and provided no clear path forward. I was told the issue could or may not be resolved, and despite my repeated requests, I was not permitted to speak with a supervisor. The lack of continuity, transparency, and accountability is completely unacceptable and deeply distressing. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, Aidvantage has placed my loans into forbearance while they attempt to resolve their internal error, further disadvantaging me as a responsible borrower. This forbearance negatively impacts my progress toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ), by potentially disqualifying these months from my qualifying payment count. I feel I am being punished for a failure that is entirely theirs. I have done everything asked of me, complied with all requirements and deadlines, and stayed on top of my repayment obligations. \\n\\nThis situation has caused me extreme XXXX. I am currently experiencing a high-risk XXXX, and this ongoing issue is directly affecting my health and well-being. The time and energy required to repeatedly follow up with Aidvantageoften during business hourshas also interfered with my responsibilities as a XXXX XXXX XXXX compounding my XXXX and professional burden. \\n\\nI respectfully request immediate intervention to : 1. Correct my monthly payment to the appropriate amount ( approximately {$1300.00} per PAYE guidelines ).\\n\\n2. Remove the forbearance designation and ensure all eligible months count toward PSLF.\\n\\n3. Prevent any negative credit reporting, interest capitalization, or financial penalties resulting from this error.\\n\\n4. Hold Aidvantage accountable for its failure to resolve this acknowledged issue and the unacceptable lack of internal communication and customer support.\\n\\nI am happy to provide documentation including income verification, repayment plan records, correspondence logs, and more.\\n\\nThank you for your time and attention to this matter. \\n\\nSincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX, I requested a breakdown of my loans with each payment amount. \\n\\nThe amounts include the payment amount for each loan I have which totals 11 active loans. However, the payment on the letter I received shows that I ow {$530.00} per month and this letter was dated XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\nHowever, on my online account, its showing I owe {$770.00} per month and I received XXXX explanation why its such a huge jump. I received a paper letter with the {$530.00} effective payment amount starting XX/XX/year&gt;. While online I was sent a notification on XX/XX/XXXX with the amount of {$770.00} each month. \\n\\nThis is a HUGE discrepancy and there is XXXX explanation. I also don't understand how such a big mistake can be made and put in writing with a lower payment and then when I called Aidvantage they are telling me I have to pay the {$770.00} amount even though they themselves have XXXX explanation., Loan servicer was changed without notice to Aidvantage from XXXX. They claimed to have sent a letter but I did not receive that notice. \\n\\nAs soon as I found out in XXXX, I logged in to set up payments. Reviewing the account, I discovered they had the wrong payment amount ( higher than previous noting i was not part of an income based program ). Digging into the issue, they had the wrong total and possibly even incorrect interest rates. \\n\\nThat same day, I made a call and asked for corrections. \\n\\nThey failed to action. \\n\\nI tried again, and was met with issues even getting them to answer their phone. \\n\\nIn XXXX, they said they had a work order in to correct. Called later to see what happened and they claimed not to have a work order on file. \\n\\nI went through several rounds of this going back and making complaints to XXXX and to the XXXX  on a couple occasions. \\n\\nThe last time I spoke to them, they indicated they would fix the account and remove the interest that accrued while dealing with the issue. \\n\\nThey never sent me notice except to check the account. But they did XXXX things. \\nXXXX they never actioned to correct the initial error or explain the issue. \\nXXXX they made several changes to my account without notice or permission XXXX the chose to only communicate through their website requiring be to log in and accept horrendously unacceptable &amp; likely illegal terms of service including personal liability prior to being able to ensure the account is correct. \\n\\nYesterday I called again to get the correction. They said \" wait time is over XXXX minutes '' and they never answered. After several minutes there was a beep and the hold music stopped. I waited in silence for several more minutes, totalling over XXXX minutes before I had to hang up and go back to work. \\n\\nThis is not the first time they failed to answer a call. \\n\\nThe loan would be fully paid if they had corrected it in XXXX. \\n\\nI have been working on this problem now for XXXX  years. \\n\\nI don't know what to do, but this organization was recommended through a XXXX search. \\n\\nHow do I get my issue corrected?, In XX/XX/XXXX ( CFPB ID : XXXX ) I asked why my SAVE application was not processed AND/OR PLACED IN FORBEARANCE WITH NO INTEREST ACCRUAL. On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., I paid off my student loans in XXXX The Department of education/aidvantage keeps asking me for money. I had contacted a representative at aidvantage letting them know that I have documentation from the bank and they had made an error. Whoever I spoke with said that they would look into it, but aidvantage is still asking me for money and ruining my credit score., I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \\n\\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \\n\\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \\n\\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \\n\\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \\n\\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \\n\\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \\n\\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \\n\\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \\n\\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \\n\\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\\n\\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \\n\\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\\n\\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \\n\\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\\n\\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I am submitting a formal dispute against Aidvantage for inaccurately reporting my student loan under a name and date of birth that are not mine, in violation of federal consumer protection laws. While I did take out the loan, the account was reported using incorrect personal identifiers that do not match my legal identity. \\n\\nThis has caused significant damage to my credit, including a XXXX drop in my XXXX XXXX. After I filed my original complaint with the CFPB, Aidvantage responded by stating that they would update the information if I provided a government-issued ID. I did not provide my ID because I am not requesting a correction I am disputing the legitimacy and legality of the account as it currently exists. The loan was reported with false information from the start and must be deleted, not amended. \\n\\nFurthermore, XXXX has already removed the incorrect name and date of birth from my credit file, confirming that this data is not associated with me. Aidvantage, however, continues to report the account under those same false identifiers, demonstrating noncompliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681e ( b ), which requires all consumer data to be accurate and verifiable.\\n\\nAidvantage has failed to conduct a meaningful investigation or resolve the dispute. Instead, they placed the burden on me to fix their reporting error which is not my legal obligation under the FCRA. Their failure to correct or delete this unverifiable account is causing ongoing financial harm and distress. \\n\\nI am requesting that the CFPB enforce the law and require Aidvantage to permanently delete this account from all credit reporting agencies, as it is tied to inaccurate and unverified personal information. This matter has gone unresolved for far too long, despite multiple efforts to dispute it properly., I am submitting this complaint regarding the federal student loan forgiveness program announced by the XXXX XXXX in XXXX \\n\\nI applied for and was approved for up to {$20000.00} in loan forgiveness. Based on official guidance and the repeated extensions of the payment pause, I was led to reasonably believe that my balance would be reduced before repayment resumed. \\n\\nFollowing this official direction, I did not make payments, as federal communication indicated no payments were necessary while forgiveness was pending. However, after the program was overturned by the Supreme Court, no alternative relief or adjustment was provided to borrowers like myself who acted in good faith based on government promises. \\n\\nAs a result, I am now considered behind on my loans, not because of negligence, but because I trusted the guidance given at the time. I feel this situation is extremely unfair and has caused me financial and emotional stress. It has been a major mental and emotional struggle to even motivate myself to repay now, because it feels fundamentally unjust to be penalized for following what the government instructed me to do. \\n\\nI respectfully request that my loan account be restored to good standing without penalties or negative credit reporting. Additionally, due to the false hope provided and the harm caused by being placed into delinquency, I am formally requesting that a meaningful percentage of my loan balance be forgiven as compensation for the damage caused. \\n\\nBorrowers who relied on government communications should not be punished. I followed all instructions provided, and I am simply asking for fair treatment based on the promises that were made. Thank you for your urgent review and assistance., Complaint Against : Aidvantage ( https : //aidvantage.studentaid.gov ) Date of Incident : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX, I was notified that my student loans had been reported as past due. This was alarming, as I had previously been enrolled in automated ACH payments and my monthly payments were being pulled without issue. \\n\\nUpon calling Aidvantage, I was informed that my loan had been transferred to their servicing in XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of this transfer, so I asked the representative how I had been notified. They stated a transfer email was sent. I asked what email address the notification was sent to and what email address it came from. The representative was only able to confirm the email address it should have been sent to which is correct but could not provide the senders address. \\n\\nTo be thorough, I searched my email account ( where no emails are ever deleted ), and I found no record of any communication from Aidvantage prior to the day I signed up for an account on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI requested a copy of the original transfer notification letter, and the representative stated a request was submitted for it to be resent and that I should receive it by XXXX As of today, I still have not received a copy of the transfer letter. \\n\\nAdditionally, I asked why my automated payment information was not transferred from the previous servicer. The representative did not provide an answer to this question. \\n\\nThe representative also stated that multiple calls were made to notify me, but I advised that no voicemails or messages were ever left, and I have no record of any calls from Aidvantage prior to XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThis lack of proper notification and failure to carry over my auto-payment setup has negatively impacted my credit. I was never made aware of the servicing change, and the automatic payments I had in place were not maintained through the transition., I am on an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan and submitted my recertification to Aidvantage. My application is marked as processing, but I was informed it can not be completed due to a court order. Despite this, my monthly payment has tripled. \\n\\nI explained to Aidvantage that the Department of Education extended IDR recertification deadlines until at least XX/XX/XXXX for all IDR plans not just SAVE and that borrowers should not be penalized while processing is delayed. They refused to adjust my payment or offer administrative forbearance. \\n\\nDuring a live chat on XX/XX/XXXX, an Aidvantage representative named XXXX made an unprofessional political comment, saying : Sorry for the inconvenience this is due to the president and his order which as we all can see is no greater than him. I found this highly inappropriate and irrelevant to my repayment issue. \\n\\nThis behavior is unacceptable from a federally contracted loan servicer, and I believe Aidvantage is failing to follow both policy and professional conduct standards., I am requesting that the late payment be removed from my credit report as reported by aidVantage. I have contacted them to request they contact the credit bureaus but they have refused, ignored and been belligerent with me. They have done me serious harm for something that is entirely their fault. \\n\\nThey took my student loan from XXXX and even though XXXX had my correct, updated information, aidVantage was contacting dramatically outdated addresses, emails and I have no idea what phone number, if any, they had. \\n\\nSo I had NO idea that my previously deferred loan was with this new company, was no longer deferred, and payments were due until XXXX XXXX alerted me to a XXXX point drop in my credit. In a couple days I paid everything outstanding and brought it to date and tried to find out what happened. \\n\\n\\nIn short, aidVantage was sending mail to addresses from XXXX on XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I lived in XXXX from XXXX through XXXX which I can prove, and have lived at XXXX addresses after this. I now live at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and have for over a XXXX  months. SO none of their mail was reaching me. In the attachment you will see XXXX was sending mail to my house at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX so aidVantage has no excuse to have used a XXXX XXXX XXXX address. \\n\\nI have attached proof that XXXX was mailing my current home and that any email to the address aidVantage claims they were using would have been bounced back to them- so that one they should have known was not being received. I also have attached proof that even my DL was at the address this company was using, so there is no reason for them to have using this old address.. \\n\\nNow my family could not even rent safe housing in XXXX due to to the negligence of this company. This is like the electric company sending your light bill to your neighbors and shutting of your lights when you don't pay! Now I am paying dearly for it in the form of drastically reduced credit score and will be for years to come - this is not right! \\n\\nI have attached evidence. Please assist me in getting this mark removed from my credit report. I have contacted the Department of Education in XXXX but since that department is now essentially gone, there is nobody to help., I'm having a lot of issues logging into Aidvantage to pay off my XXXX XXXX. I got so many notifications from my credit card company that my credit score is going down, and I'm trying to fix it, but for some reason my SSN and birthday combination isn't working for me to login to Aidvantage. I need this resolved ASAP., On XX/XX/year&gt;, I called Aidvantage to make a payment and explicitly instructed the rep to apply {$75.00} to Loan XXXX DL and {$40.00} to Loan XXXX DL. I confirmed this several times, and the rep assured me this would not be a problem. The call was recorded. \\n\\nI made this call specifically because Ive had issues with the online pay by loan feature misallocating payments. I explained this to the rep, and she confirmed that doing it by phone would ensure the split was applied correctly. \\n\\nDespite that, Aidvantage processed the payment as {$100.00} to XXXX XXXX and {$7.00} to XXXX XXXX, completely ignoring my instructions. \\n\\nIm ahead on my loan payments and have the legal right to direct prepayments however I choose. This is supported by XXXX CFR XXXX ( f ) ( XXXX ), which gives borrowers the right to prepay any loan at any time without penalty and to direct how those payments are applied., I XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. I had taken out loans with XXXX XXXX each year to pay for my college expenses. I XXXX with roughly {$30000.00} in debt. Half of this total was paid off in XXXX upon XXXX. In XXXX, I consolidated the rest of my loan with XXXX. I have been paying them ever since, and am currently in good standing. In XXXX of XXXX, Aidvantage claimed I owed them over {$12000.00}. I did not notice this until it started to affect my credit. Late in XXXX of XXXX, I contacted Aidvantage to sort the issue out. They were rude, hung up on me, and were not giving me proper information about how I owed them money. This is affecting my credit and making my life harder. Everything with XXXX XXXX is paid off, as XXXX has the rest of the loan. I do not owe Aidvantage any money, and their delinquency charges of late payment needs to be removed from my credit.]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. Instead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. When I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. Aidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me., There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. I am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., Since auto-payment receives a small discount on the loan payment, I suspect the company of skimming the dollar and change that my payment amount should be reduced by per month. Please assist me in correcting this behavior, so that other borrowers are not informed of an auto-debit only to have these bad actors play games with our loan accounts., I am devastated. I would like to report a situation with my student loans. I recently found out my loans were in default. I have never been in default with my student loans. They notified me on my email instead to mail that I was delinquent. Needless to say I had nine accounts that went 90 days past due and dropped my score over XXXX points. I have Aid Avantage and I did not know who the servicer was until I reviewed my credit report. I would like for them to remove the past due notice off of all 9 accounts. I was denied a student loan for my daughter and we dont know what we are going to do because of it. Also there have been 2 credit card closures from my credit because of this., I set up autopay with AidVantage, where my department of education loans are. Autopay was set up on XX/XX/XXXX, for my monthly due date on the XXXX of each month., On XX/XX/XXXX I submit another payment through the NelNet site for {$1500.00} to cover the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX payments. Again the payment showed as processed then I received a notice the payment was no processed again a few days later. I called NelNet and the representative said the receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX reject the payment. Again this is the same account I've used for years to make these payments. I called XXXX and they have no record of payments attempted and confirmed the account is in good status with sufficient funds. I asked NelNet to reprocess the payment on the phone and to back date the payment to the original date it was processed to avoid the extra interest accrued and they said they would not do it. They instructed me to delete my auto pay, do a one-time payment, then reset my auto pay, which I am in the process of completing., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. You have been formally notified., XX/XX/XXXX I increased the amount to automatically be paid each month from {$790.00} to {$850.00}. The payment showed as paid on the student loan provider ( NelNet ) as of XX/XX/XXXX, but did not clear my XXXXXXXX XXXX account. It is the same bank account I've had associated with the auto debit for years. A few days later I received a notice the payment never went through., I keep setting up auto-debit with NelNet, get confirmation, and then the payments aren't processing. In XXXX of XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX I tried to set up auto debit for my loan. I go back in and the website shows I didn't make a payment. I have received multiple confirmations that I have been set up for auto-debit and then NelNet deletes the record. I have a paper letter confirming auto-payment enrollment from XX/XX/XXXX, but the website keeps deleting my payment data., I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report.

These accounts include all loanssubsidized, unsubsidized, and Parent PLUSand their continued presence on my report constitutes an egregious violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection law. It has come to light through extensive reporting and insider disclosures that entities affiliated with or under the operational influence of XXXX XXXX, specifically DOGE-related ventures, gained illegal and unrestricted access to sensitive borrower data stored within Department of Education systems. This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. The unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. Furthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly.

This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved.

              "      <td>[According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year&gt;, but nothing else. \\n\\nIf i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue. This is absurd., Several things are going on with Nelnet. \\n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\\n\\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\\n\\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem., I received notice that my XXXX score dropped from XXXX to XXXX. I checked my credit report and it listed Nelnet. I have never heard of Nelnet before. I looked online and found out it is the new loan servicer. I tried to create an account, but all the information I used to log in claimed that it was incorrect information, and I used every possible email address and phone number I have had in the past. None were accepted. \\n\\nAfter being unable to log in, I tried to call Nelnet. The hold times were multiple hours and I was unable to complete a contact. They also display a mailing address to make payments, but without logging in I am unsure what payments need to be made. I have no financial difficulties in paying back the loans, but I have been simply unable to functionally send the payments or log in., The issue I have with repaying my loans is that there was major miscommunication regarding the pay back of my federal student loans. I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. From there, I consolidated what I believed were my federal and private loans. Since the day I graduated, I have never missed a single payment on repaying my loans. XXXX weeks ago, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that my XXXX XXXX dropped. It is now in the XXXX range when it has been between XXXX my entire life. I checked why it dropped and it was because Nelnet reported missed student aid payments to my credit since XX/XX/XXXX. Meanwhile, I have never heard of Nelnet. I had to create an account with them to view what the issue was. From there, I saw there were were loans that were apparently not refinanced into my original account from XXXX years ago, which was very odd and shocking. I had no idea those loans even existed, nor was I ever told my loans were sold from Great Lakes to Nelnet. The email they somehow had on file was not an email address I use, so I never saw any of their email correspondences. They rarely called and if they did, it was a pre-recorded voicemail, not an actual person, whereupon they would ask for my social security number right away. The address they had on file was also not my address, so I never received any mail. My father cosigned on my loans and he was never contacted in any capacity from them. They also do not have my legal name on file. My legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. They somehow only had \" XXXX XXXX '' in their system, despite me never having an account to begin with, which is alarming. I am extremely concerned about my credit score being as low as it is and when I spoke to someone on the phone to explain the situation and emphasized their lack of communication, they said there was nothing they could do that, despite the loans not even technically being in my name, which I have major issues with and am extremely confused by. Now, I am stuck with a terrible credit score and wondering what happened with this whole situation. First, I would like to know whether or not those loans are truly mine given that my legal name is not the name attached to those loans. This is causing me to question whether or not there was some sort of foul play here because I always use my legal name on official documents and legal matters. Second, I am wondering if Nelnet can contact the credit companies to take all these missed payments off my record due to their poor communication and if I am obligated to pay those loans, then I will make the payments., I don't believe I was adequately informed about my student loan delinquency. I recieved 3 calls from nelnet between XXXX &amp; XXXX. No physical mail, no emails, no voicemails. I was unaware of exactly when my loan repayment was to resume. The representative I spoke to from Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX ) had informed me that I was delinquent 140+ days, but that doesn't make sense. That means I was supposed to start repaying in XX/XX/XXXX, but before my loan switched over from great lakes to Nelnet, It said that I did not have to pay until sometime XXXX. As a result of this, my credit score dropped 165 points. This is after 10 years of credit history never missing a payment. Something must be done about this. I know there are 1000 's of other postgrad students in the same situation as me. Thank you., On XX/XX/XXXX, I was shocked to discover a significant drop in my credit scorefrom XXXX to XXXX. Assuming there was fraudulent activity, I immediately filed a report with XXXX to investigate. The report revealed that Nelnet had posted 16 delinquent payments to my accountall on the same day. \\n\\nConfused, I contacted Nelnet and learned that they had taken over my student loans from Great Lakes. Under Great Lakes, I was enrolled in an income-driven deferment program due to unemployment, meaning I was not required to make payments. However, when Nelnet assumed control of my loans, they removed my deferment status without notifying me. Complicating matters further, I had originally three loans with Great Lakes, but Nelnet reorganized them into 16 separate accounts, drastically increasing the impact of their reporting. \\n\\nSince I had moved out of state, I never received any mail from Nelnet, leaving me completely unaware of the situation. I was also unable to set up an online account with them initially, as my address did not match what they had on file. After persistent efforts, I finally gained access to my Nelnet account and started receiving correspondence. \\n\\nAdding to my frustration, I discovered that Nelnet is currently facing multiple class-action lawsuits for similar issues. When I asked them for details about my loan transition, they could not provide any information about my original Great Lakes balances or interest rates. Since Great Lakes is no longer in service, I have no way of verifying my previous records. \\n\\nI have formally disputed the delinquent payments with XXXX, as I was never informed of them, yet Nelnet refuses to remove them. For 16 years, I maintained an excellent credit history, and this sudden, unjust drop in my score is now severely impacting my ability to demonstrate creditworthiness., The call made to Nelnet was to inquire as to how the interest worked. The rate listed in 6.5 % but I see the information below on my account and cant make sense of it : Payment Amount {$19.00}XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Principal {$11.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Interest {$8.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Applied to Fees* {$0.00} They informed to go to my loan agreement but I dont have that information, and my loan servicer they should have it, if that is how they are applying payment etc. They should know the ins and outs of my agreement. It appears predatory and secrative and not very informative as to interest calculation and when the end of my payments will be etc. \\nAll I am asking is for the amortization table to make sense of my payments etc. I get that payment is applied to interest first, but it is a lot more than 6.5 %. A car can be paid off in 6 years with more interest than this and I dont have an end date for my payments. \\n\\nI am sure I am not the only student loan holder with issues with Nelnet. Thank you for your time. Any help you can provide deeply appreciated., My loan was placed in deferment for the month of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating I had a payment due of XXXX that payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into Nelnet and I reviewed my dashboard it States that I now have a payment of XXXX due on XX/XX/XXXX which was more then what was listed on the bill. On XX/XX/XXXX I make a payment of XXXX and receive a confirmation email stating the payment was received and will reflect on my account on XX/XX/XXXX and processing can take up to XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I log back into nelnet to ensure payment processed. Under my dashboard it states I still owe XXXX however a payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I receive an email from nelnet stating XXXX monthly payment of XXXX was due on XXXX XXXX. At this time I was unable to contact nelnet because they were closed. On XXXX XXXX I contact nelnet at XXXX eastern time to discuss the matter. At this time I explained to the advisor the same thing I explained above. She stated the bank returned payment. I asked why I was not informed of the matter prior to this phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. She states shes not sure but I would be able to make a payment now to ensure my account is in good standings. At this time I did make a payment and I did receive another confirmation email stating that the payment effective date would be XX/XX/XXXX and would not reflect on my account as past due. Today I open up the nelnet app to ensure everything is going accordingly and I notice that my new payment states that I owe XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that there is a late payment of XXXX. I called nelnet again to speak about the matter.. I was told dont worry about it it wont reflect on your credit report unless its 90 days past due at this time it is only one day past due again I made the payment and i spoke with an advisor who also stated my payment would not reflect a late payment as the effective date would be the due date and I had nothing to worry about. It is obvious that they are into late reporting and it need to be addressed as Im sure I am not the only person going through false reporting at this time., I have student loans with NelNet - 7 total accounts. I had been paying on them monthly. For the last 4 months I've been unable to get into my account. Even resetting my password didn't work because no emails would show up with the verification code. I tried this over 10 times and no verification emails ever came through. I searched and also had no \" billing statements '' or \" past due account '' notices in my email. I also hadn't received any regular mail. I decided I would keep trying to get into my account, since it appeared I wasn't behind. Fast forward to today when my credit score drops from XXXX to XXXX. Instantly, I pulled my report to see why, and there are 6 accounts ( all paid by XXXX to XXXX service provider ) now listed as delinquent with ZERO notifications since XX/XX/year&gt;. I called them to find out the issue, my auto pay wasn't working and I was {$690.00} dollars past due. {$690.00} ... .let that sit and because it is one payment spread across XXXX accounts, they marked XXXX of those delinquent. Why the XXXX wasn't marked, I have no idea. But regardless, that hit 's your credit score XXXX harder for XXXX payment, a past due balance I was unaware of. So I took a XXXX point drop for {$690.00} due to NelNets failure to communicate or use my auto pay., Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been attempting to log into my Nelnet account to pay my loan : I was unable to log in, noting that my password was incorrect. I reset my password, it didn't work. Made multiple attempts, and then reached out to Nelnet directly. Despite back and forth correspondence, including requesting my personal details in order to provide me my account number directly, no resolution was achieved. My account information was never given ( see attached item # 1 ). \\n\\nSeeing the 90 day late payment notice on my credit report, I called Nelnet today, XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed I, inexplicably, have a new username ( see item # 2 for previous studentaid.gov username, and new Nelnet username. ) It is unclear to me why this was not mentioned in the multiple attempts at resolving this issue, or why the nelnet login portal did not tell me the username was 'incorrect ' even though it successfully sent the password reset links to my email address. \\n\\nAfter this, my outstanding balance was paid immediately and in full ( item # 3 ). I asked to speak to a supervisor, who refused to acknowledge any of this. I attempted to share with him the litany of online complaints ( see item # 4 ) about this EXACT issue.]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?, I am currently a full-time student at a medical school. I have never taken any leave of absence and I have ALWAYS been full-time. I started to receive emails from XXXX that I had a payment due. When I finally checked my account, I was delinquent for a payment. I have currently have three loans, all from the same school, and only one says \" Repayment due '' while the other two say \" In school. '' This is clearly wrong. Why is only one loan marked as \" repayment '' while the other two clearly show that I am \" in school ''??\\n\\nThe first time I called, the customer representative said she verified that I was a full-time student and would put a request to change my loan status.\\n\\nThe status was never changed. Today I called, approximately two weeks after the first call, and the customer service representative this time said I was not a full-time student. This does not make any sense since it is within the SAME semester. \\n\\nI am BEYOND frustrated with this loan servicer. They are not giving me accurate information and not fixing my problem! I can NOT make payments as I AM a full-time student and I need my loan status fixed ASAP., I XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. I had taken out loans with XXXX XXXX each year to pay for my college expenses. I XXXX with roughly {$30000.00} in debt. Half of this total was paid off in XXXX upon XXXX. In XXXX, I consolidated the rest of my loan with XXXX. I have been paying them ever since, and am currently in good standing. In XXXX of XXXX, Aidvantage claimed I owed them over {$12000.00}. I did not notice this until it started to affect my credit. Late in XXXX of XXXX, I contacted Aidvantage to sort the issue out. They were rude, hung up on me, and were not giving me proper information about how I owed them money. This is affecting my credit and making my life harder. Everything with XXXX XXXX is paid off, as XXXX has the rest of the loan. I do not owe Aidvantage any money, and their delinquency charges of late payment needs to be removed from my credit., I hope this message finds you well. I want to share my experience regarding an error on my credit report related to my student loan account Loan Servicer : Aidvantage Account # XXXX. My report shows a 90-day late payment, which I believe is incorrect. \\n\\nA 90-day late payment indicates that Ive missed three payments in a row, which can significantly impact my credit score. In reality, my payment history is current, and I have only missed one payment, which should be reported as a 30-day late payment instead. The difference between these two statuses is substantial, and I want to ensure that my credit report accurately reflects my payment behavior. \\n\\nI also want to highlight that according to the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Section 9-507, creditors are required to report accurate information about a consumers payment history. Misreporting can lead to misunderstandings about my financial responsibility and affect my ability to secure loans in the future.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my concerns. I appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide regarding this matter., I contacted Edfinancial about my federal student loan and {$12000.00} capitalized interest added to my overall balance due to XXXX ( previous ) loan servicer transferring my student loan over to Edfinancial via forbearance. Also I have received conflicting information about the number of payments made to public service loan forgiveness from both edfinancial and studentaid.gov. I graduated from school in 2017 and have been making on time payments in full since and now my balance is increasing due to mismanagement and inaccurate accounting on part of loan services. Also my credit score has went down because of this poor mismanagement, I took out federal student loans with Nelnet in XXXX for an engineering program that I was in. XXXX ended that and I moved across the country.The government deferred payments on the student loans for XXXX to XXXX years and apparently have just restarted payments as of XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any communication from Nelnet regarding the startup of these payments, partially my fault due to the changes in my contact information. However, I was just notified by a XXXX XXXX alert that I had received a XXXX delinquency on their loan which I have only XXXX payment, XXXX have separated into XXXX separate loans thus reported XXXX separate XXXX  day delinquent notifications that reduced my XXXX XXXX by XXXX points overnight. I contacted them and immediately paid the past due balance plus the current month and intend on fully paying every single month until this loan is resolved. There was poor communication in regards to when these loans were going to restart and I did not receive any notification personally. Due to laws allowing them to not report delinquent payments until XXXX days. I was then hit with a XXXX day delinquency on a loan that I make XXXX payment on, but they have split into XXXX accounts. Thus giving me XXXX separate XXXX day delinquent payments on my credit report dropping my credit from a rising XXXX to XXXX overnight. This completely destroyed my credit for years to come. Up to XXXX XXXX students are facing the same situation and there are hundreds of thousands of people online complaining about the same thing happening to them. Nelnet, due to the way that they report delinquencies only has to report it after XXXX days, not giving me the opportunity to make current before a catastrophic credit reduction. There are news articles all over the XXXX and XXXX with thousands of responses from people having the same situation happen to them. I asked Nelnet if since I immediately resolved the past due balance, if there was any way that they could do me a XXXX time favor and remove those derogatory marks from my credit reporting to save my credit after never having a prior late payment. They said no, and it was my problem. Considering the millions of people who are affected by this, and the lack of communication and transparency involved in making students aware after XXXX  years of deferred repayment. I immediately resolved the balance with intent to pay the entire balance off within a year. I believe these late payments were due to lack of communication and nothing else. I believe that with my good faith payment resolving the past due balance, and the current month due that combined with the XXXX of any prior reporting at XXXX or XXXX days, thus notifying me in order to resolve it prior to the XXXX  day mark, which has such a huge impact on my XXXX XXXX that I should be able to request the removal of those XXXX  day delinquencies from my credit report. Nelnet refuses to assist even after correcting this balance, but this is going to set me back for years to come and hurt me in areas essential to my growth and contribution to society. Due to the widespread amount of people affected by this, I hope that there is a plan in place to help honest, hard-working citizens from losing their ability to grow and contribute to the society and economy. I take responsibility for letting it slip my mind after XXXX years of deferred payments mandated by the XXXX government and have steadily grown my credit score over the last XXXX years to get to the point where I was. This is devastating to me and thousands and thousands of other Americans. Due to the abnormality of this long-term student loan, deferment and lack of communication I believe that at the very least they should be accepting XXXX letters and removing those negative marks from my credit report. Now that Im aware, if I were to make late payments. There would be no complaint on my part. But this essentially destroyed my credit overnight., On XX/XX/XXXX, I was shocked to discover a significant drop in my credit scorefrom XXXX to XXXX.

Thank you for your time. Any help you can provide deeply appreciated., My two loans had a principal of {$4500.00}. They are now {$9100.00}. This is because XXXX repeatedly steered me into the wrong types of forbearances. They sold my loan to Aidvantage ( of course, immediately before they are barred ) who refuses to help me. This is criminal. I fulfill every single requirement for the loans to be discharged through the settlement yet never received any word of this. XXXX promptly sold my loan to Aidvantage who immediately capitalized ALL my interest that XXXX forced me into. As you know they have been barred from Federal loans because of how they deceived people like me. Again, I fulfill EVERY condition of the XXXX adjustment. Why is nobody helping me at CFPB? Why is XXXX and Aidvantage allowed to consistently break the law and charge me unlawful amounts? Where is my protection?!?!?!??, Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \\n\\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \\nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \\n\\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year&gt;, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year&gt;, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year&gt;, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year&gt;. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \\n\\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \\nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \\nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries.]</td>\n",

First, I would like to know whether or not those loans are truly mine given that my legal name is not the name attached to those loans. This is causing me to question whether or not there was some sort of foul play here because I always use my legal name on official documents and legal matters. Second, I am wondering if Nelnet can contact the credit companies to take all these missed payments off my record due to their poor communication and if I am obligated to pay those loans, then I will make the payments., Several things are going on with Nelnet. \\n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\\n\\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\\n\\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem., Originally, I took out Financial Aid between XXXX - XXXX. I was the first in my family to attend college at XXXX. Therefore, I was not aware and was never told by my financial aid officer that I would have to repay these. I did not realize that I had to pay everything back until XXXX. At that time, I did get on a payment plan and I remember it was around {$40000.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX took control of the loan for a few years. Then, it went to NelNet without my knowledge or consent. I have received emails to make payments or update my information. When I go online, it constantly locks me out saying my information is incorrect. The last time I did go on ( XXXX ) it said that I do not have to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX with no reason why. However, my balance and debt continues to grow in my credit report. Over the past 10 years, despite payments, my balance has increased 18 %. My credit report says the highest balance is {$58000.00}. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it says the balance is {$69000.00}. That is literally a difference of {$10000.00}. On NelNet it says my outstanding principle is {$62000.00} with interest of {$6600.00}. None of these numbers match or add up. I have never received a breakdown as to why or received information on my loan or the interest of the loan. And yet, my credit is suffering because of this. It seems that I am not required to pay and yet the interest ( which I have no idea what that is ) is continuing to grow. I am filing a complaint based on incorrect information, lack of communication, lack of documentation, unethical and unapproved transfers of my loans, and the possible violations of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and the improper handling of student loan data by the Department of Education ( DOE )., The call made to Nelnet was to inquire as to how the interest worked. The rate listed in 6.5 % but I see the information below on my account and cant make sense of it : Payment Amount {$19.00}XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Principal {$11.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Interest {$8.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Applied to Fees* {$0.00} They informed to go to my loan agreement but I dont have that information, and my loan servicer they should have it, if that is how they are applying payment etc. They should know the ins and outs of my agreement. It appears predatory and secrative and not very informative as to interest calculation and when the end of my payments will be etc. \\nAll I am asking is for the amortization table to make sense of my payments etc. I get that payment is applied to interest first, but it is a lot more than 6.5 %. A car can be paid off in 6 years with more interest than this and I dont have an end date for my payments. \\n\\nI am sure I am not the only student loan holder with issues with Nelnet. Thank you for your time. Any help you can provide deeply appreciated., Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been attempting to log into my Nelnet account to pay my loan : I was unable to log in, noting that my password was incorrect. I reset my password, it didn't work. Made multiple attempts, and then reached out to Nelnet directly. Despite back and forth correspondence, including requesting my personal details in order to provide me my account number directly, no resolution was achieved. My account information was never given ( see attached item # 1 ). \\n\\nSeeing the 90 day late payment notice on my credit report, I called Nelnet today, XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed I, inexplicably, have a new username ( see item # 2 for previous studentaid.gov username, and new Nelnet username. ) It is unclear to me why this was not mentioned in the multiple attempts at resolving this issue, or why the nelnet login portal did not tell me the username was 'incorrect ' even though it successfully sent the password reset links to my email address. \\n\\nAfter this, my outstanding balance was paid immediately and in full ( item # 3 ). I asked to speak to a supervisor, who refused to acknowledge any of this. I attempted to share with him the litany of online complaints ( see item # 4 ) about this EXACT issue., I received notice that my XXXX score dropped from XXXX to XXXX. I checked my credit report and it listed Nelnet. I have never heard of Nelnet before. I looked online and found out it is the new loan servicer. I tried to create an account, but all the information I used to log in claimed that it was incorrect information, and I used every possible email address and phone number I have had in the past. None were accepted. \\n\\nAfter being unable to log in, I tried to call Nelnet. The hold times were multiple hours and I was unable to complete a contact. They also display a mailing address to make payments, but without logging in I am unsure what payments need to be made. I have no financial difficulties in paying back the loans, but I have been simply unable to functionally send the payments or log in., Subject : Complaint Against Student Loan Servicer, NELNET for Misconduct XXXX. Loan Servicer Information : Servicer Name : Nelnet Type of Loan : Federal XXXX. Nature of Complaint : Select all that apply : Incorrect loan balance reported Misapplied or missing payments Wrongful denial of repayment plan ( e.g., Income-Driven Repayment ) Other : Charging interest on subsidized loans while borrower is in in-school deferment XXXX. Description of the Issue : I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/year&gt;, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \\n\\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year&gt;. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \\nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}. My in-school deferment was wrongfully denied, despite meeting the eligibility requirements. \\n\\nXXXX. Supporting Documents Available Upon Request : Loan Number and Borrower Information Payment records Loan statements Email/chat transcripts with servicer Other : Screenshot of current balance and continued interest, Subject : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Servicer Name : Nelnet Loan Account Number : XXXX Type of Loan : Federal 3. Nature of Complaint : Inaccurate reporting to credit bureaus Unlawful collection practices I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/scrub&gt;XXXX I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$58000.00}, despite my payments being up to date. my request for an Income-Driven Repayment Plan was wrongfully denied, despite meeting eligibility requirements. Also it has been unauthorized access to my account which is a direct violation of my privacy., I was not contacted by Nelnet about my student loan balance until they put my account into delinquency. I have now received multiple hits to my credit that has dropped my credit score by around 115 points. I set up a payment schedule with Nelnet, and have brought my account up to date, but I am still getting hits to my credit that is tanking my credit score., Nelnet applies any extra payments I make first toward interest rather than the entire amount toward the principal. This creates an XXXX/unfair situation where I am not able to reduce the total principal amount that is being charged interest unless I first pay all of the interest., Nelnet did not inform me of my payments needing to resume. No emails, no calls, no written correspondence. My loan is now is default and I had no information this was forthcoming, or what options I had before this transpired., My loan was placed in deferment for the month of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating I had a payment due of XXXX that payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into Nelnet and I reviewed my dashboard it States that I now have a payment of XXXX due on XX/XX/XXXX which was more then what was listed on the bill. On XX/XX/XXXX I make a payment of XXXX and receive a confirmation email stating the payment was received and will reflect on my account on XX/XX/XXXX and processing can take up to XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I log back into nelnet to ensure payment processed. Under my dashboard it states I still owe XXXX however a payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I receive an email from nelnet stating XXXX monthly payment of XXXX was due on XXXX XXXX. At this time I was unable to contact nelnet because they were closed. On XXXX XXXX I contact nelnet at XXXX eastern time to discuss the matter. At this time I explained to the advisor the same thing I explained above. She stated the bank returned payment. I asked why I was not informed of the matter prior to this phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. She states shes not sure but I would be able to make a payment now to ensure my account is in good standings. At this time I did make a payment and I did receive another confirmation email stating that the payment effective date would be XX/XX/XXXX and would not reflect on my account as past due. Today I open up the nelnet app to ensure everything is going accordingly and I notice that my new payment states that I owe XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that there is a late payment of XXXX. I called nelnet again to speak about the matter.. I was told dont worry about it it wont reflect on your credit report unless its 90 days past due at this time it is only one day past due again I made the payment and i spoke with an advisor who also stated my payment would not reflect a late payment as the effective date would be the due date and I had nothing to worry about. It is obvious that they are into late reporting and it need to be addressed as Im sure I am not the only person going through false reporting at this time., I have student loans with NelNet - 7 total accounts. I had been paying on them monthly. For the last 4 months I've been unable to get into my account. Even resetting my password didn't work because no emails would show up with the verification code. I tried this over 10 times and no verification emails ever came through. I searched and also had no \" billing statements '' or \" past due account '' notices in my email. I also hadn't received any regular mail. I decided I would keep trying to get into my account, since it appeared I wasn't behind. Fast forward to today when my credit score drops from XXXX to XXXX. Instantly, I pulled my report to see why, and there are 6 accounts ( all paid by XXXX to XXXX service provider ) now listed as delinquent with ZERO notifications since XX/XX/year&gt;. I called them to find out the issue, my auto pay wasn't working and I was {$690.00} dollars past due. {$690.00} ... .let that sit and because it is one payment spread across XXXX accounts, they marked XXXX of those delinquent. Why the XXXX wasn't marked, I have no idea. But regardless, that hit 's your credit score XXXX harder for XXXX payment, a past due balance I was unaware of. So I took a XXXX point drop for {$690.00} due to NelNets failure to communicate or use my auto pay., I am writing to express serious concerns about a recent situation involving my student loans serviced by Nelnet. Since the XXXX loan deferment period, I had been consistently making payments on my Parent PLUS loans, believing that I was current and in good standing. At no point did I receive any communication from Nelnetvia phone, physical mail, or emailindicating that another loan under my name had become delinquent. \\n\\nInstead, Nelnet sent email communications regarding the outstanding balance to my father. Upon receiving XXXX such message, he contacted Nelnet and referenced the account number provided in the email, but was informed that Nelnet had no record of that account number. This further contributed to our confusion and concern. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, while preparing to purchase a new vehicle for my growing family ( with a baby due in early XXXX ), I checked my credit report and was shocked to find that my credit score had plummeted from XXXX to XXXX since XXXX. Fearing identity theft, I ordered a full credit report, only to discover XXXX delinquencies reported by Nelnet totaling approximately {$39000.00}. \\n\\nWhen I called Nelnet for clarification, I was met with indifference. I was told to simply create an online account and begin paying the delinquent balance. When I inquired why I was never contacted directlyby phone, physical mail, or through my own email addressI was told, We sent an email ; we did our part. When I explained that these emails were not sent to me, the representative essentially shrugged it off. \\n\\nThis situation has had a severe and immediate impact on my financial wellbeing and ability to support my family. I believe this lack of communication and refusal to take accountability is negligent and potentially unlawful., On XX/XX/XXXX, I was shocked to discover a significant drop in my credit scorefrom XXXX to XXXX. Assuming there was fraudulent activity, I immediately filed a report with XXXX to investigate. The report revealed that Nelnet had posted 16 delinquent payments to my accountall on the same day. \\n\\nConfused, I contacted Nelnet and learned that they had taken over my student loans from Great Lakes. Under Great Lakes, I was enrolled in an income-driven deferment program due to unemployment, meaning I was not required to make payments. However, when Nelnet assumed control of my loans, they removed my deferment status without notifying me. Complicating matters further, I had originally three loans with Great Lakes, but Nelnet reorganized them into 16 separate accounts, drastically increasing the impact of their reporting. \\n\\nSince I had moved out of state, I never received any mail from Nelnet, leaving me completely unaware of the situation. I was also unable to set up an online account with them initially, as my address did not match what they had on file. After persistent efforts, I finally gained access to my Nelnet account and started receiving correspondence. \\n\\nAdding to my frustration, I discovered that Nelnet is currently facing multiple class-action lawsuits for similar issues. When I asked them for details about my loan transition, they could not provide any information about my original Great Lakes balances or interest rates. Since Great Lakes is no longer in service, I have no way of verifying my previous records. \\n\\nI have formally disputed the delinquent payments with XXXX, as I was never informed of them, yet Nelnet refuses to remove them. For 16 years, I maintained an excellent credit history, and this sudden, unjust drop in my score is now severely impacting my ability to demonstrate creditworthiness.]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year&gt;, but nothing else. \\n\\nIf i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue. This is absurd., I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance., Several things are going on with Nelnet. \\n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest.

Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem., On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying my credit score dropped. When I opened my banking app, I saw that my credit dropped XXXX points overnight. I saw that the Department of Education was named on the loans, so I called the Dept. of Ed. on the XXXX. I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : \" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX. We have included a copy of the Welcome Letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. '' This portion of the letter does not clarify the address to which the Welcome Letter was sent. I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. \" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. '' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due. I have previously requested dates of contact, proof of the addresses used to reach me, and evidence of my acknowledgment of the billing statements. \" Per your promissory note, it is your responsibility to update your contact information to ensure that you receive important communications regarding your student loan account. '' I would like to emphasize that I was unable to update my contact information on an account I was unaware of, nor did I know that such a website existed for this purpose. Finally, the latest response I received claimed to attach a Master Promissory Note stating my responsibility to make payments despite never receiving a bill. The Master Promissory Note was never attached to the response. I have never seen this Master Promissory Note and have yet to receive such a document from the company., I don't believe I was adequately informed about my student loan delinquency. I recieved 3 calls from nelnet between XXXX &amp; XXXX. No physical mail, no emails, no voicemails. I was unaware of exactly when my loan repayment was to resume. The representative I spoke to from Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX ) had informed me that I was delinquent 140+ days, but that doesn't make sense. That means I was supposed to start repaying in XX/XX/XXXX, but before my loan switched over from great lakes to Nelnet, It said that I did not have to pay until sometime XXXX. As a result of this, my credit score dropped 165 points. This is after 10 years of credit history never missing a payment. Something must be done about this. I know there are 1000 's of other postgrad students in the same situation as me. Thank you., The issue I have with repaying my loans is that there was major miscommunication regarding the pay back of my federal student loans. I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. From there, I consolidated what I believed were my federal and private loans. Since the day I graduated, I have never missed a single payment on repaying my loans. XXXX weeks ago, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that my XXXX XXXX dropped. It is now in the XXXX range when it has been between XXXX my entire life. I checked why it dropped and it was because Nelnet reported missed student aid payments to my credit since XX/XX/XXXX. Meanwhile, I have never heard of Nelnet. I had to create an account with them to view what the issue was. From there, I saw there were were loans that were apparently not refinanced into my original account from XXXX years ago, which was very odd and shocking. I had no idea those loans even existed, nor was I ever told my loans were sold from Great Lakes to Nelnet. The email they somehow had on file was not an email address I use, so I never saw any of their email correspondences. They rarely called and if they did, it was a pre-recorded voicemail, not an actual person, whereupon they would ask for my social security number right away. The address they had on file was also not my address, so I never received any mail. My father cosigned on my loans and he was never contacted in any capacity from them. They also do not have my legal name on file. My legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. They somehow only had \" XXXX XXXX '' in their system, despite me never having an account to begin with, which is alarming. I am extremely concerned about my credit score being as low as it is and when I spoke to someone on the phone to explain the situation and emphasized their lack of communication, they said there was nothing they could do that, despite the loans not even technically being in my name, which I have major issues with and am extremely confused by. Now, I am stuck with a terrible credit score and wondering what happened with this whole situation. First, I would like to know whether or not those loans are truly mine given that my legal name is not the name attached to those loans. This is causing me to question whether or not there was some sort of foul play here because I always use my legal name on official documents and legal matters. Second, I am wondering if Nelnet can contact the credit companies to take all these missed payments off my record due to their poor communication and if I am obligated to pay those loans, then I will make the payments., I am filing a complaint against Nelnet for delaying my student loan discharge and refunddespite confirmation from the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ) that my discharge is already complete. \\nI'm a former student of a XXXX XXXX school ( aka XXXX &amp; XXXX ), and my loans have been flagged for discharge under ED since XX/XX/2022. In XXXX of this year, I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told they already completed the discharge, and it's now Nelnets responsibility to implement it. \\n\\nHowever, Nelnet continues to drag out the discharge process, adding to the confusion by partially discharging the loans and sending a partial refund check ( via the XXXX XXXX ). They also sent me a letter that misled me into making payments on accruing interest that I later found out I wasn't responsible for., I am writing to express serious concerns about a recent situation involving my student loans serviced by Nelnet.

After persistent efforts, I finally gained access to my Nelnet account and started receiving correspondence. \\n\\nAdding to my frustration, I discovered that Nelnet is currently facing multiple class-action lawsuits for similar issues. When I asked them for details about my loan transition, they could not provide any information about my original Great Lakes balances or interest rates. Since Great Lakes is no longer in service, I have no way of verifying my previous records. \\n\\nI have formally disputed the delinquent payments with XXXX, as I was never informed of them, yet Nelnet refuses to remove them. For 16 years, I maintained an excellent credit history, and this sudden, unjust drop in my score is now severely impacting my ability to demonstrate creditworthiness., Several things are going on with Nelnet. \\n1. I used to have Great Lakes Borrowers. They were organized and easy to use their website and make payments. Since they're no longer around it went to Nelnet ( not my choice ). I made a payment last month for {$750.00}, when I went to make another payment they added {$430.00} in interest. That is absolutely outrageous to charge me that much, considering I'm not even being sent payments until next year.\\n\\n2. Nelnet will not let me view any statements of previous payments made to Great Lakes.\\n\\n3. Nelnet is showing I have FOUR loans to pay back. I should only be paying on XXXX 's and that's it. Same as Great Lakes. Nelnet has Western Govern University ( from XXXX ) and University XXXX XXXX. BOTH have been paid off already! I paid them off years ago, probably XXXX around there. I've tried to research the actual payments through the federal aid website and can't find any payments I've made to them. They're claiming I've paid less than {$2000.00} total. When I've contacted student aid they refuse to help me claiming Nelnet needs to do it when Nelnet is the literal problem., I received notice that my XXXX score dropped from XXXX to XXXX. I checked my credit report and it listed Nelnet. I have never heard of Nelnet before. I looked online and found out it is the new loan servicer. I tried to create an account, but all the information I used to log in claimed that it was incorrect information, and I used every possible email address and phone number I have had in the past. None were accepted. \\n\\nAfter being unable to log in, I tried to call Nelnet. The hold times were multiple hours and I was unable to complete a contact. They also display a mailing address to make payments, but without logging in I am unsure what payments need to be made. I have no financial difficulties in paying back the loans, but I have been simply unable to functionally send the payments or log in., I don't believe I was adequately informed about my student loan delinquency. I recieved 3 calls from nelnet between XXXX &amp; XXXX. No physical mail, no emails, no voicemails. I was unaware of exactly when my loan repayment was to resume. The representative I spoke to from Nelnet ( XX/XX/XXXX ) had informed me that I was delinquent 140+ days, but that doesn't make sense. That means I was supposed to start repaying in XX/XX/XXXX, but before my loan switched over from great lakes to Nelnet, It said that I did not have to pay until sometime XXXX. As a result of this, my credit score dropped 165 points. This is after 10 years of credit history never missing a payment. Something must be done about this. I know there are 1000 's of other postgrad students in the same situation as me. Thank you., The issue I have with repaying my loans is that there was major miscommunication regarding the pay back of my federal student loans. I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. From there, I consolidated what I believed were my federal and private loans. Since the day I graduated, I have never missed a single payment on repaying my loans. XXXX weeks ago, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that my XXXX XXXX dropped. It is now in the XXXX range when it has been between XXXX my entire life. I checked why it dropped and it was because Nelnet reported missed student aid payments to my credit since XX/XX/XXXX. Meanwhile, I have never heard of Nelnet. I had to create an account with them to view what the issue was. From there, I saw there were were loans that were apparently not refinanced into my original account from XXXX years ago, which was very odd and shocking. I had no idea those loans even existed, nor was I ever told my loans were sold from Great Lakes to Nelnet. The email they somehow had on file was not an email address I use, so I never saw any of their email correspondences. They rarely called and if they did, it was a pre-recorded voicemail, not an actual person, whereupon they would ask for my social security number right away. The address they had on file was also not my address, so I never received any mail. My father cosigned on my loans and he was never contacted in any capacity from them. They also do not have my legal name on file. My legal name is XXXX XXXX XXXX. They somehow only had \" XXXX XXXX '' in their system, despite me never having an account to begin with, which is alarming. I am extremely concerned about my credit score being as low as it is and when I spoke to someone on the phone to explain the situation and emphasized their lack of communication, they said there was nothing they could do that, despite the loans not even technically being in my name, which I have major issues with and am extremely confused by. Now, I am stuck with a terrible credit score and wondering what happened with this whole situation. First, I would like to know whether or not those loans are truly mine given that my legal name is not the name attached to those loans. This is causing me to question whether or not there was some sort of foul play here because I always use my legal name on official documents and legal matters. Second, I am wondering if Nelnet can contact the credit companies to take all these missed payments off my record due to their poor communication and if I am obligated to pay those loans, then I will make the payments., The call made to Nelnet was to inquire as to how the interest worked. The rate listed in 6.5 % but I see the information below on my account and cant make sense of it : Payment Amount {$19.00}XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Principal {$11.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Interest {$8.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Applied to Fees* {$0.00} They informed to go to my loan agreement but I dont have that information, and my loan servicer they should have it, if that is how they are applying payment etc. They should know the ins and outs of my agreement. It appears predatory and secrative and not very informative as to interest calculation and when the end of my payments will be etc. \\nAll I am asking is for the amortization table to make sense of my payments etc. I get that payment is applied to interest first, but it is a lot more than 6.5 %. A car can be paid off in 6 years with more interest than this and I dont have an end date for my payments. \\n\\nI am sure I am not the only student loan holder with issues with Nelnet. Thank you for your time. Any help you can provide deeply appreciated., My loan was placed in deferment for the month of XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating I had a payment due of XXXX that payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into Nelnet and I reviewed my dashboard it States that I now have a payment of XXXX due on XX/XX/XXXX which was more then what was listed on the bill. On XX/XX/XXXX I make a payment of XXXX and receive a confirmation email stating the payment was received and will reflect on my account on XX/XX/XXXX and processing can take up to XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I log back into nelnet to ensure payment processed. Under my dashboard it states I still owe XXXX however a payment was received on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I receive an email from nelnet stating XXXX monthly payment of XXXX was due on XXXX XXXX. At this time I was unable to contact nelnet because they were closed. On XXXX XXXX I contact nelnet at XXXX eastern time to discuss the matter. At this time I explained to the advisor the same thing I explained above. She stated the bank returned payment. I asked why I was not informed of the matter prior to this phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. She states shes not sure but I would be able to make a payment now to ensure my account is in good standings. At this time I did make a payment and I did receive another confirmation email stating that the payment effective date would be XX/XX/XXXX and would not reflect on my account as past due. Today I open up the nelnet app to ensure everything is going accordingly and I notice that my new payment states that I owe XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that there is a late payment of XXXX. I called nelnet again to speak about the matter.. I was told dont worry about it it wont reflect on your credit report unless its 90 days past due at this time it is only one day past due again I made the payment and i spoke with an advisor who also stated my payment would not reflect a late payment as the effective date would be the due date and I had nothing to worry about. It is obvious that they are into late reporting and it need to be addressed as Im sure I am not the only person going through false reporting at this time., Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been attempting to log into my Nelnet account to pay my loan : I was unable to log in, noting that my password was incorrect. I reset my password, it didn't work. Made multiple attempts, and then reached out to Nelnet directly. Despite back and forth correspondence, including requesting my personal details in order to provide me my account number directly, no resolution was achieved. My account information was never given ( see attached item # 1 ). \\n\\nSeeing the 90 day late payment notice on my credit report, I called Nelnet today, XX/XX/XXXX, and was informed I, inexplicably, have a new username ( see item # 2 for previous studentaid.gov username, and new Nelnet username. ) It is unclear to me why this was not mentioned in the multiple attempts at resolving this issue, or why the nelnet login portal did not tell me the username was 'incorrect ' even though it successfully sent the password reset links to my email address. \\n\\nAfter this, my outstanding balance was paid immediately and in full ( item # 3 ). I asked to speak to a supervisor, who refused to acknowledge any of this. I attempted to share with him the litany of online complaints ( see item # 4 ) about this EXACT issue., I have student loans with NelNet - 7 total accounts. I had been paying on them monthly. For the last 4 months I've been unable to get into my account. Even resetting my password didn't work because no emails would show up with the verification code. I tried this over 10 times and no verification emails ever came through. I searched and also had no \" billing statements '' or \" past due account '' notices in my email. I also hadn't received any regular mail. I decided I would keep trying to get into my account, since it appeared I wasn't behind. Fast forward to today when my credit score drops from XXXX to XXXX. Instantly, I pulled my report to see why, and there are 6 accounts ( all paid by XXXX to XXXX service provider ) now listed as delinquent with ZERO notifications since XX/XX/year&gt;. I called them to find out the issue, my auto pay wasn't working and I was {$690.00} dollars past due. {$690.00} ... .let that sit and because it is one payment spread across XXXX accounts, they marked XXXX of those delinquent. Why the XXXX wasn't marked, I have no idea. But regardless, that hit 's your credit score XXXX harder for XXXX payment, a past due balance I was unaware of. So I took a XXXX point drop for {$690.00} due to NelNets failure to communicate or use my auto pay., I am writing to express serious concerns about a recent situation involving my student loans serviced by Nelnet. Since the XXXX loan deferment period, I had been consistently making payments on my Parent PLUS loans, believing that I was current and in good standing. At no point did I receive any communication from Nelnetvia phone, physical mail, or emailindicating that another loan under my name had become delinquent. \\n\\nInstead, Nelnet sent email communications regarding the outstanding balance to my father. Upon receiving XXXX such message, he contacted Nelnet and referenced the account number provided in the email, but was informed that Nelnet had no record of that account number. This further contributed to our confusion and concern. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, while preparing to purchase a new vehicle for my growing family ( with a baby due in early XXXX ), I checked my credit report and was shocked to find that my credit score had plummeted from XXXX to XXXX since XXXX. Fearing identity theft, I ordered a full credit report, only to discover XXXX delinquencies reported by Nelnet totaling approximately {$39000.00}. \\n\\nWhen I called Nelnet for clarification, I was met with indifference. I was told to simply create an online account and begin paying the delinquent balance. When I inquired why I was never contacted directlyby phone, physical mail, or through my own email addressI was told, We sent an email ; we did our part. When I explained that these emails were not sent to me, the representative essentially shrugged it off. \\n\\nThis situation has had a severe and immediate impact on my financial wellbeing and ability to support my family. I believe this lack of communication and refusal to take accountability is negligent and potentially unlawful., I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?, I am currently a full-time student at a medical school. I have never taken any leave of absence and I have ALWAYS been full-time. I started to receive emails from XXXX that I had a payment due. When I finally checked my account, I was delinquent for a payment. I have currently have three loans, all from the same school, and only one says \" Repayment due '' while the other two say \" In school. '' This is clearly wrong. Why is only one loan marked as \" repayment '' while the other two clearly show that I am \" in school ''??\\n\\nThe first time I called, the customer representative said she verified that I was a full-time student and would put a request to change my loan status.\\n\\nThe status was never changed. Today I called, approximately two weeks after the first call, and the customer service representative this time said I was not a full-time student. This does not make any sense since it is within the SAME semester. \\n\\nI am BEYOND frustrated with this loan servicer. They are not giving me accurate information and not fixing my problem! I can NOT make payments as I AM a full-time student and I need my loan status fixed ASAP., I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance., I XXXX XXXX  in XXXX. I had taken out loans with XXXX XXXX each year to pay for my college expenses. I XXXX with roughly {$30000.00} in debt. Half of this total was paid off in XXXX upon XXXX. In XXXX, I consolidated the rest of my loan with XXXX. I have been paying them ever since, and am currently in good standing. In XXXX of XXXX, Aidvantage claimed I owed them over {$12000.00}. I did not notice this until it started to affect my credit. Late in XXXX of XXXX, I contacted Aidvantage to sort the issue out. They were rude, hung up on me, and were not giving me proper information about how I owed them money. This is affecting my credit and making my life harder. Everything with XXXX XXXX is paid off, as XXXX has the rest of the loan. I do not owe Aidvantage any money, and their delinquency charges of late payment needs to be removed from my credit., I hope this message finds you well. I want to share my experience regarding an error on my credit report related to my student loan account Loan Servicer : Aidvantage Account # XXXX. My report shows a 90-day late payment, which I believe is incorrect. \\n\\nA 90-day late payment indicates that Ive missed three payments in a row, which can significantly impact my credit score. In reality, my payment history is current, and I have only missed one payment, which should be reported as a 30-day late payment instead. The difference between these two statuses is substantial, and I want to ensure that my credit report accurately reflects my payment behavior. \\n\\nI also want to highlight that according to the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Section 9-507, creditors are required to report accurate information about a consumers payment history. Misreporting can lead to misunderstandings about my financial responsibility and affect my ability to secure loans in the future.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my concerns. I appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide regarding this matter., On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying my credit score dropped. When I opened my banking app, I saw that my credit dropped XXXX points overnight. I saw that the Department of Education was named on the loans, so I called the Dept. of Ed. on the XXXX. I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : \" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX. We have included a copy of the Welcome Letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. '' This portion of the letter does not clarify the address to which the Welcome Letter was sent. I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. \" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. '' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due. I have previously requested dates of contact, proof of the addresses used to reach me, and evidence of my acknowledgment of the billing statements. \" Per your promissory note, it is your responsibility to update your contact information to ensure that you receive important communications regarding your student loan account. '' I would like to emphasize that I was unable to update my contact information on an account I was unaware of, nor did I know that such a website existed for this purpose. Finally, the latest response I received claimed to attach a Master Promissory Note stating my responsibility to make payments despite never receiving a bill. The Master Promissory Note was never attached to the response. I have never seen this Master Promissory Note and have yet to receive such a document from the company., I contacted Edfinancial about my federal student loan and {$12000.00} capitalized interest added to my overall balance due to XXXX ( previous ) loan servicer transferring my student loan over to Edfinancial via forbearance. Also I have received conflicting information about the number of payments made to public service loan forgiveness from both edfinancial and studentaid.gov. I graduated from school in 2017 and have been making on time payments in full since and now my balance is increasing due to mismanagement and inaccurate accounting on part of loan services. Also my credit score has went down because of this poor mismanagement, I took out federal student loans with Nelnet in XXXX for an engineering program that I was in. XXXX ended that and I moved across the country.The government deferred payments on the student loans for XXXX to XXXX years and apparently have just restarted payments as of XX/XX/XXXX. I never received any communication from Nelnet regarding the startup of these payments, partially my fault due to the changes in my contact information. However, I was just notified by a XXXX XXXX alert that I had received a XXXX delinquency on their loan which I have only XXXX payment, XXXX have separated into XXXX separate loans thus reported XXXX separate XXXX  day delinquent notifications that reduced my XXXX XXXX by XXXX points overnight. I contacted them and immediately paid the past due balance plus the current month and intend on fully paying every single month until this loan is resolved. There was poor communication in regards to when these loans were going to restart and I did not receive any notification personally. Due to laws allowing them to not report delinquent payments until XXXX days. I was then hit with a XXXX day delinquency on a loan that I make XXXX payment on, but they have split into XXXX accounts. Thus giving me XXXX separate XXXX day delinquent payments on my credit report dropping my credit from a rising XXXX to XXXX overnight. This completely destroyed my credit for years to come. Up to XXXX XXXX students are facing the same situation and there are hundreds of thousands of people online complaining about the same thing happening to them. Nelnet, due to the way that they report delinquencies only has to report it after XXXX days, not giving me the opportunity to make current before a catastrophic credit reduction. There are news articles all over the XXXX and XXXX with thousands of responses from people having the same situation happen to them. I asked Nelnet if since I immediately resolved the past due balance, if there was any way that they could do me a XXXX time favor and remove those derogatory marks from my credit reporting to save my credit after never having a prior late payment. They said no, and it was my problem. Considering the millions of people who are affected by this, and the lack of communication and transparency involved in making students aware after XXXX  years of deferred repayment. I immediately resolved the balance with intent to pay the entire balance off within a year. I believe these late payments were due to lack of communication and nothing else. I believe that with my good faith payment resolving the past due balance, and the current month due that combined with the XXXX of any prior reporting at XXXX or XXXX days, thus notifying me in order to resolve it prior to the XXXX  day mark, which has such a huge impact on my XXXX XXXX that I should be able to request the removal of those XXXX  day delinquencies from my credit report. Nelnet refuses to assist even after correcting this balance, but this is going to set me back for years to come and hurt me in areas essential to my growth and contribution to society. Due to the widespread amount of people affected by this, I hope that there is a plan in place to help honest, hard-working citizens from losing their ability to grow and contribute to the society and economy. I take responsibility for letting it slip my mind after XXXX years of deferred payments mandated by the XXXX government and have steadily grown my credit score over the last XXXX years to get to the point where I was. This is devastating to me and thousands and thousands of other Americans. Due to the abnormality of this long-term student loan, deferment and lack of communication I believe that at the very least they should be accepting XXXX letters and removing those negative marks from my credit report. Now that Im aware, if I were to make late payments. There would be no complaint on my part. But this essentially destroyed my credit overnight., I am filing a complaint against Nelnet for delaying my student loan discharge and refunddespite confirmation from the U.S. Department of Education ( ED ) that my discharge is already complete. \\nI'm a former student of a XXXX XXXX school ( aka XXXX &amp; XXXX ), and my loans have been flagged for discharge under ED since XX/XX/2022. In XXXX of this year, I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX and was told they already completed the discharge, and it's now Nelnets responsibility to implement it. \\n\\nHowever, Nelnet continues to drag out the discharge process, adding to the confusion by partially discharging the loans and sending a partial refund check ( via the XXXX XXXX ). They also sent me a letter that misled me into making payments on accruing interest that I later found out I wasn't responsible for., My two loans had a principal of {$4500.00}. They are now {$9100.00}. This is because XXXX repeatedly steered me into the wrong types of forbearances. They sold my loan to Aidvantage ( of course, immediately before they are barred ) who refuses to help me. This is criminal. I fulfill every single requirement for the loans to be discharged through the settlement yet never received any word of this. XXXX promptly sold my loan to Aidvantage who immediately capitalized ALL my interest that XXXX forced me into. As you know they have been barred from Federal loans because of how they deceived people like me. Again, I fulfill EVERY condition of the XXXX adjustment. Why is nobody helping me at CFPB? Why is XXXX and Aidvantage allowed to consistently break the law and charge me unlawful amounts? Where is my protection?!?!?!??, Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \\n\\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \\nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \\n\\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year&gt;, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year&gt;, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year&gt;, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year&gt;. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \\n\\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \\nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \\nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries., I was not contacted by Nelnet about my student loan balance until they put my account into delinquency. I have now received multiple hits to my credit that has dropped my credit score by around 115 points.

On XX/XX/year&gt;, I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$3700.00} instead of {$3500.00} due to interest charges, despite my payments being up to date and my qualifications as a student on a subsidized loan. Additionally, the payment of {$200.00} made on XX/XX/scrub&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX was misapplied with {$82.00} going to interest instead of the full amount going to principal. \\n\\nI contacted customer service on XX/XX/scrub&gt;XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX customer service assured me that they had received my in-school deferment request from XXXX XXXX with an effective date of XX/XX/year&gt;. She also confirmed that interest on this loan does not accrue while I am in school, so the {$200.00} payment I sent on XX/XX/XXXX would be redistributed to the principal only. \\nToday, my loan is continuing to accrue interest and is up to {$5400.00}. My in-school deferment was wrongfully denied, despite meeting the eligibility requirements. \\n\\nXXXX. Supporting Documents Available Upon Request : Loan Number and Borrower Information Payment records Loan statements Email/chat transcripts with servicer Other : Screenshot of current balance and continued interest, Originally, I took out Financial Aid between XXXX - XXXX. I was the first in my family to attend college at XXXX. Therefore, I was not aware and was never told by my financial aid officer that I would have to repay these. I did not realize that I had to pay everything back until XXXX. At that time, I did get on a payment plan and I remember it was around {$40000.00}. XXXX XXXX XXXX took control of the loan for a few years. Then, it went to NelNet without my knowledge or consent. I have received emails to make payments or update my information. When I go online, it constantly locks me out saying my information is incorrect. The last time I did go on ( XXXX ) it said that I do not have to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX with no reason why. However, my balance and debt continues to grow in my credit report. Over the past 10 years, despite payments, my balance has increased 18 %. My credit report says the highest balance is {$58000.00}. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it says the balance is {$69000.00}. That is literally a difference of {$10000.00}. On NelNet it says my outstanding principle is {$62000.00} with interest of {$6600.00}. None of these numbers match or add up. I have never received a breakdown as to why or received information on my loan or the interest of the loan. And yet, my credit is suffering because of this. It seems that I am not required to pay and yet the interest ( which I have no idea what that is ) is continuing to grow. I am filing a complaint based on incorrect information, lack of communication, lack of documentation, unethical and unapproved transfers of my loans, and the possible violations of my rights under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) and the improper handling of student loan data by the Department of Education ( DOE ).]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year&gt;, but nothing else. If i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue., On XX/XX/XXXX I submit another payment through the NelNet site for {$1500.00} to cover the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX payments. Again the payment showed as processed then I received a notice the payment was no processed again a few days later. I called NelNet and the representative said the receiving bank ( XXXX XXXX reject the payment. Again this is the same account I've used for years to make these payments. I called XXXX and they have no record of payments attempted and confirmed the account is in good status with sufficient funds. I asked NelNet to reprocess the payment on the phone and to back date the payment to the original date it was processed to avoid the extra interest accrued and they said they would not do it. They instructed me to delete my auto pay, do a one-time payment, then reset my auto pay, which I am in the process of completing., I keep setting up auto-debit with NelNet, get confirmation, and then the payments aren't processing. In XXXX of XXXX, XXXX of XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX I tried to set up auto debit for my loan. I go back in and the website shows I didn't make a payment. I have received multiple confirmations that I have been set up for auto-debit and then NelNet deletes the record. I have a paper letter confirming auto-payment enrollment from XX/XX/XXXX, but the website keeps deleting my payment data., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. You have been formally notified., XX/XX/XXXX I increased the amount to automatically be paid each month from {$790.00} to {$850.00}. The payment showed as paid on the student loan provider ( NelNet ) as of XX/XX/XXXX, but did not clear my XXXXXXXX XXXX account. It is the same bank account I've had associated with the auto debit for years. A few days later I received a notice the payment never went through., This account was transferred to Nelnet ( NNI ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; who had engaged in acts of deception and made numerous errors on the account, as well as having broken numerous consumer protection laws, including the FDCPA, FCRA, TCPA, Indiana Senior Consumer Protection Act, Indiana Deceptive Consumers Sales Act. This occurred in XXXX and XXXX., XXXX now has my loan transferred from Navient. XXXX is missing {$26000.00} in payments I made to Navient. Navient can only refer me to XXXX and claims they have no records of my payments., The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month., Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., We then sent letters to Nelnet by Certified Mail ( CM ) several times in XXXX and XXXX, detailing the serious misconduct by XXXX. Despite signing for the CM and acknowledging receipt of the written complaint and violations of law, XXXX never responded to the CM, nor provided any answers to the questions raised in the CM. XXXX never corrected any of the errors- some of which may have been not just errors but deliberate acts of covering-up acts of deception. XXXX then began a series of doing many of the same violations of law. XXXX seems to have a Compliance Problem.]</td>\n",

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved., I was in an XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plan for almost XXXX years. I consolidated my loans in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of the one-time account adjustment and when I consolidated I selected the lowest payment plan which was XXXX. Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn't have to worry. I uploaded the paper version of the XXXX application that day. \\nBecause of my XXXX application, I received a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX stating that \" We recently received your income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) application, but since a federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and other XXXX plans, XXXX application processing is taking longer than normal. \\nDue to these delays your XXXX application is in a pending status and MOHELA is putting your account into a forbearance for up to XXXX  days. '' My XXXX  application got denied due to a missing signature ( even though a Mohela supervisor looked over my application and told me it was complete ), so after calling and speaking with another supervisor to determine why my XXXX was denied, I submitted a new XXXX application on XX/XX/XXXX with the signature needed. That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file. Unfortunately I have been trying to call to ask and can not get through to anyone because of the outrageously long hold times. However, I did receive a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX ( I will upload ) that said \" A federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and some other XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) plans. As a result of this ruling, XXXX has directed MOHELA to put your account into a forbearance because either : XXXX. You are currently a borrower on XXXX. \\nXXXX. XXXX  Days have passed since we received your XXXX application, and it has not yet been processed. '' So again, like last time, I was told my account was in forbearance. Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, my account is saying PAST DUE from XXXX and I have another payment coming up on XX/XX/XXXX. I am worried this will wrongfully affect my credit. Clearly the forbearance was not properly put on my account. I have been trying every day to call for XXXX month, but each time I call the wait time is XXXX hours and I can never get through to a representative. In the past even if I was able to get a hold of an account representative, the first agent I spoke with insisted I had to be transferred. When I get transferred I am just put on hold for hours on end and a supervisor never calls me back, so my account is still wrongfully showed past due. I have called about this issue every day for the past month. The shortest wait time is XXXX hours even during the recommended time to call which is Thursday and Friday from XXXX. I will continue to try to call to resolve this issue, but in the meanwhile I felt this complaint was necessary as Im worried I will soon be reported to collections. Mohela is operating a deflection scheme to avoid resolving the issue and updating my account status., In XX/XX/XXXX ( CFPB ID : XXXX ) I asked why my SAVE application was not processed AND/OR PLACED IN FORBEARANCE WITH NO INTEREST ACCRUAL. On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., I am enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan and have made XXXX qualifying payments toward student loan forgiveness. I recently discovered that my loans were placed in forbearance without my request or notification, beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. This change has caused my recent payments to be marked ineligible, which is delaying my progress toward full forgiveness. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed Aidvantage ( my loan servicer ) requesting removal from forbearance, restoration of my IDR repayment status, and confirmation that I would not lose credit toward forgiveness. I have received no response. \\n\\nI have since submitted a new IDR application and selected the option to exit forbearance, but I want to ensure : My qualifying payment count is restored and continues uninterrupted. \\n\\nThe forbearance is not extended or reapplied. \\n\\nAidvantage is held accountable for failing to respond or provide transparency regarding my account changes. \\n\\nI am less than 10 months from forgiveness and this situation has caused unnecessary stress and delays. I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assist in securing an immediate resolution., I received a letter stating \" On XX/XX/XXXX, a federal court issued a stay preventing the Department of Education ( ED ) from operating the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan. As a result of this ruling, ED has directed Nelnet to put your account into a forbearance. While you are in this forbearance no payment is required on your account and your interest rate will be set to 0 %. This means no interest will accrue while you are in the forbearance. If you made or make a payment for the month ( s ) you are in the forbearance, the amounts paid will go toward satisfying your future payment ( s ). \" As of XX/XX/XXXX, my account continues to accrue interest. \\n\\nAlso, the website has not provided monthly statements since XX/XX/XXXX showing current balance and what payments were applied., Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \\n\\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \\nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \\n\\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year&gt;, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year&gt;, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year&gt;, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year&gt;. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \\n\\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \\nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \\nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries., In XXXX, I submitted a complaint to XXXX. \\n\\nI was steered into long term forbearance and deferments. Ultimately I defaulted for a few years because I wasn't offered XXXX. I rehabilitated my loans and then was pushed into forbearance I've been paying on these loans in some capacity since XXXX. I've been unable to keep track of who has my loan and what's been done to my loans over the years because I've been shuffled from one company to the other ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Aidvantage ). I have gotten little information regarding the one-time acount review. It has taken months to get contact back regarding my initial requests I have requested numerous updatse. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX added a message XX/XX/XXXX XXXX AM I am still awaiting a response and resolution to this request. It has been over 1 year since I submitted this request and have not received a response. Please review and respond with adjustments to my account specifically for the illegal and other predatory lending practices for which XXXX was found liable.

I am requesting a full discharge of my loans due to these violations and failure to provide a MPN, failure to respond to inquiries in a timely manner., I requested to be placed on the XXXX plan and was placed on forbearance. During this wait period, I was emailed a statement saying that my interest would now be 0 % pending the review for my application until next year. Fast forward a few months later, I'm still collecting interest on my principal balance and now it's as if I had made no payments at all! Some loans were paused but some were still steadily accruing while the forbearance period hasn't ended yet. I'm at a lost and don't know where I can go to get help for this. It doesn't feel right because I had let my guard down after receiving that letter, that I can finally rest for a bit from repayment but this has been a true nightmare for me. I'd like to get back on repaying as soon as possible, please help!, On XX/XX/year&gt;, put in a request for deferment since I was laid off from my job at the time and had called to speak with the provider who said they would fax over the documents needed, but didn't. Emailed about the same issue and then was emailed the link. I don't think the deferment ever fully was acknowledged and I was immediately put into delinquency and have been for the last 15 years back and forth with numerous providers which has only racked up interest and overall looming stress.]</td>\n",

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance., I am submitting this formal complaint to bring to your attention a serious violation of my consumer rights and data privacy committed by Navient, a federal student loan servicer. \\n\\nIt has come to my attention that Navient has shared, disclosed, or otherwise permitted access to my personal, financial, or sensitive information without my informed consent or authorization. This action is unacceptable and unlawful under several federal statutes designed to protect consumers personal data. \\n\\nSpecifically, Navients conduct violates the following laws and regulations : Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ( GLBA ), 15 U.S.C. XXXX This act requires financial institutions to explain their information-sharing practices and to safeguard sensitive data. There is no record of Navient providing me with proper disclosure nor obtaining my consent prior to the dissemination of my private information. \\n\\nPrivacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a This act strictly limits the sharing of personal data maintained by federal agencies or their contractors ( including student loan servicers ) without written consent or statutory authorization. \\n\\nFair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. Under this law, consumer information may only be shared for permissible purposes with clear and specific consumer authorization. \\n\\nNavients unauthorized disclosure of my private information has not only breached these laws but has also placed me at risk of financial harm, fraud, and invasion of privacy. As a responsible borrower actively working to improve and repair my credit standing, this type of negligent behavior undermines my financial security and erodes trust in the federal loan servicing system. \\n\\nDemand for Immediate Resolution I hereby request the following corrective actions : A full and formal investigation into Navients unlawful disclosure of my personal data.\\n\\nImmediate written confirmation detailing when, to whom, and for what purpose my information was shared.\\n\\nImmediate cessation of all unauthorized data-sharing practices related to my account. \\n\\nA written assurance of compliance with all applicable privacy laws going forward. \\n\\nAny available compensation, protections, or corrective actions under the law to remedy this violation. \\n\\nPlease consider this letter a formal complaint and request for action under applicable federal privacy protections.

I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \\n\\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law., RE : FORMAL DISPUTE INCORRECT LATE PAYMENT REPORTING ACCOUNT XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal dispute and demand for immediate correction regarding erroneous information being reported to the credit bureaus on the above-referenced student loan account.\\n\\nYour records reflect that this account was 90 days late XXXX time ( s ), which is entirely false and inaccurate.

On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \\n\\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \\n\\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me., Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \\n\\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \\n\\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \\n\\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer.]</td>\n",

I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., I was in an XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plan for almost XXXX years. I consolidated my loans in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of the one-time account adjustment and when I consolidated I selected the lowest payment plan which was XXXX. Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn't have to worry. I uploaded the paper version of the XXXX application that day. \\nBecause of my XXXX application, I received a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX stating that \" We recently received your income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) application, but since a federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and other XXXX plans, XXXX application processing is taking longer than normal. \\nDue to these delays your XXXX application is in a pending status and MOHELA is putting your account into a forbearance for up to XXXX  days. '' My XXXX  application got denied due to a missing signature ( even though a Mohela supervisor looked over my application and told me it was complete ), so after calling and speaking with another supervisor to determine why my XXXX was denied, I submitted a new XXXX application on XX/XX/XXXX with the signature needed. That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file. Unfortunately I have been trying to call to ask and can not get through to anyone because of the outrageously long hold times. However, I did receive a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX ( I will upload ) that said \" A federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and some other XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) plans. As a result of this ruling, XXXX has directed MOHELA to put your account into a forbearance because either : XXXX. You are currently a borrower on XXXX. \\nXXXX.

Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, my account is saying PAST DUE from XXXX and I have another payment coming up on XX/XX/XXXX. I am worried this will wrongfully affect my credit. Clearly the forbearance was not properly put on my account. I have been trying every day to call for XXXX month, but each time I call the wait time is XXXX hours and I can never get through to a representative. In the past even if I was able to get a hold of an account representative, the first agent I spoke with insisted I had to be transferred. When I get transferred I am just put on hold for hours on end and a supervisor never calls me back, so my account is still wrongfully showed past due. I have called about this issue every day for the past month. The shortest wait time is XXXX hours even during the recommended time to call which is Thursday and Friday from XXXX. I will continue to try to call to resolve this issue, but in the meanwhile I felt this complaint was necessary as Im worried I will soon be reported to collections. Mohela is operating a deflection scheme to avoid resolving the issue and updating my account status., Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \\n\\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \\nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \\n\\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year&gt;, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year&gt;, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year&gt;, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR.

I'd like to get back on repaying as soon as possible, please help!, Inaccurate info regarding forbearance .. with Sallie Mae, Unfortunately, I have found that I was taken advantage of by a textbook example of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPBs 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I contacted XXXX repeatedly due to financial hardship. Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments '' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX 's recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation. Likewise, my prior servicer, XXXX, no longer retains access to these historical records. \\nThis systemic failure to retain critical borrower documentation, compounded by coercive servicing practices, has caused enduring financial harm. I believe this case exemplifies the very forbearance and consolidation steering practices cited in prior CFPB and state attorney general actions against XXXX., XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke to a customer service representative and was informed that my loans were in XXXXadministrative ' forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and would stop accumulating interest at that time as the SAVE plan would take effect. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : Spoke to customer service representative regarding the current status of my loans. \\nI am enrolled in the SAVE plan, therefore my loans should be in forbearance and there should NOT be any interest accruing - per ( https : //studentaid.govXXXX  ). My loans ARE accruing interest and the representative was unable to give an explanation as to WHY or if the interest is going to be removed from the principal at some future date. \\n\\nI applied for the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. My loans on the Edfinancial website are listed as being part of the SAVE plan., Since my husband lost his job in XX/XX/year&gt;, I have been attempting to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan to adjust my monthly payments based on my current financial situation. Despite submitting all required documentation, Aidvantage has failed to process my request for more than a year, leaving me in financial distress. I have made multiple attempts to follow up with customer service, yet my application remains unprocessed. This negligence has resulted in unnecessary financial hardship, and I request immediate action to consolidate my loans and approve an income driven repayment plan that retroactively protects me from late fees, accrued interest, and credit impacts since filing my request on XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\nAdditionally, I seek clarification on how past policy changes, including XXXX XXXX  suspension of income-based repayment plans, have affected my ability to enroll in an IDR plan. The lack of clear communication regarding these policy changes has made it difficult for borrowers like myself to navigate repayment options effectively., I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\\n\\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX., I received a letter stating \" On XX/XX/XXXX, a federal court issued a stay preventing the Department of Education ( ED ) from operating the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan. As a result of this ruling, ED has directed Nelnet to put your account into a forbearance. While you are in this forbearance no payment is required on your account and your interest rate will be set to 0 %. This means no interest will accrue while you are in the forbearance. If you made or make a payment for the month ( s ) you are in the forbearance, the amounts paid will go toward satisfying your future payment ( s ). \" As of XX/XX/XXXX, my account continues to accrue interest. \\n\\nAlso, the website has not provided monthly statements since XX/XX/XXXX showing current balance and what payments were applied., Nelnet can not why my balance is increasing while in forbearance. Or at least I think their incorrect and blowing me off. First I was told my balance was increasing due to interest. I questioned how its increasing due to interest while my account is in forbearance period. The next response was my account is ineligible for forbearance over a period therefore I received interest charges. \\nIn XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating my account was going into forbearance and would be at a 0 % interest. \\nAt this point I dont trust anything in regards to my loans and would like supporting documents to confirm everything along with a credit for fraudulent charges., I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?]</td>\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX AZ XXXXXXXX SSN : XXXX DOB : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To : Aidvantage  / Maximus : XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX TX XXXXXXXX RE : Dispute of Unverified Student Loan Accounts Immediate Deletion Requested To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal dispute submitted in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., concerning the reporting of student loan accounts associated with Aidvantage, XXXX on my XXXX credit file. \\n\\n1.

Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments '' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX 's recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation. Likewise, my prior servicer, XXXX, no longer retains access to these historical records. \\nThis systemic failure to retain critical borrower documentation, compounded by coercive servicing practices, has caused enduring financial harm. I believe this case exemplifies the very forbearance and consolidation steering practices cited in prior CFPB and state attorney general actions against XXXX., In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved., I was in an XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) plan for almost XXXX years. I consolidated my loans in XX/XX/XXXX to take advantage of the one-time account adjustment and when I consolidated I selected the lowest payment plan which was XXXX. Because of litigation I was automatically placed in a XXXX level repayment plan which I never selected and which isnt XXXX so it wont count towards XXXX. I was initially told I am not not eligible for administrative forbearance because I was never in XXXX XXXX, but that is because of the timing of my application and the only option is for me to keep calling back to extend the forbearance. I also cant enter an XXXX plan even if I want to because there is a processing pause. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX a Mohela supervisor extended my forbearance for XXXX year through XX/XX/XXXX so I did not have to call back each month. This helped me avoid making payments on a plan that would not count towards XXXX. I have a recording of this conversation. She also helped me submit a paper application for a new XXXX plan, but said she could not guarantee when this would be processed due to the pause, but in the meanwhile I would be in forbearance so I wouldn't have to worry. I uploaded the paper version of the XXXX application that day. \\nBecause of my XXXX application, I received a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX stating that \" We recently received your income-driven repayment ( XXXX ) application, but since a federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and other XXXX plans, XXXX application processing is taking longer than normal. \\nDue to these delays your XXXX application is in a pending status and MOHELA is putting your account into a forbearance for up to XXXX  days. '' My XXXX  application got denied due to a missing signature ( even though a Mohela supervisor looked over my application and told me it was complete ), so after calling and speaking with another supervisor to determine why my XXXX was denied, I submitted a new XXXX application on XX/XX/XXXX with the signature needed. That supervisor explained that if my application is not approved before my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX, I can call to be placed on processing forbearance. She understood that I did not want to make payments that were not in an XXXX plan because they would not qualify for XXXX. She said the processing forbearance wont be done automatically, but at that point I can call and ask because theyll see the new XXXX application on file. Unfortunately I have been trying to call to ask and can not get through to anyone because of the outrageously long hold times. However, I did receive a letter from Mohela on XX/XX/XXXX ( I will upload ) that said \" A federal court issued an injunction preventing the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) from operating the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) Plan and some other XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) plans. As a result of this ruling, XXXX has directed MOHELA to put your account into a forbearance because either : XXXX. You are currently a borrower on XXXX. \\nXXXX.

Today, on XX/XX/XXXX, my account is saying PAST DUE from XXXX and I have another payment coming up on XX/XX/XXXX. I am worried this will wrongfully affect my credit. Clearly the forbearance was not properly put on my account. I have been trying every day to call for XXXX month, but each time I call the wait time is XXXX hours and I can never get through to a representative. In the past even if I was able to get a hold of an account representative, the first agent I spoke with insisted I had to be transferred. When I get transferred I am just put on hold for hours on end and a supervisor never calls me back, so my account is still wrongfully showed past due. I have called about this issue every day for the past month. The shortest wait time is XXXX hours even during the recommended time to call which is Thursday and Friday from XXXX. I will continue to try to call to resolve this issue, but in the meanwhile I felt this complaint was necessary as Im worried I will soon be reported to collections. Mohela is operating a deflection scheme to avoid resolving the issue and updating my account status., I am enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan and have made XXXX qualifying payments toward student loan forgiveness. I recently discovered that my loans were placed in forbearance without my request or notification, beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. This change has caused my recent payments to be marked ineligible, which is delaying my progress toward full forgiveness. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed Aidvantage ( my loan servicer ) requesting removal from forbearance, restoration of my IDR repayment status, and confirmation that I would not lose credit toward forgiveness. I have received no response. \\n\\nI have since submitted a new IDR application and selected the option to exit forbearance, but I want to ensure : My qualifying payment count is restored and continues uninterrupted. \\n\\nThe forbearance is not extended or reapplied. \\n\\nAidvantage is held accountable for failing to respond or provide transparency regarding my account changes. \\n\\nI am less than 10 months from forgiveness and this situation has caused unnecessary stress and delays.

When I get transferred I am just put on hold for hours on end and a supervisor never calls me back, so my account is still wrongfully showed past due. I have called about this issue every day for the past month. The shortest wait time is XXXX hours even during the recommended time to call which is Thursday and Friday from XXXX. I will continue to try to call to resolve this issue, but in the meanwhile I felt this complaint was necessary as Im worried I will soon be reported to collections. Mohela is operating a deflection scheme to avoid resolving the issue and updating my account status., I am enrolled in an Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plan and have made XXXX qualifying payments toward student loan forgiveness. I recently discovered that my loans were placed in forbearance without my request or notification, beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. This change has caused my recent payments to be marked ineligible, which is delaying my progress toward full forgiveness. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed Aidvantage ( my loan servicer ) requesting removal from forbearance, restoration of my IDR repayment status, and confirmation that I would not lose credit toward forgiveness. I have received no response. \\n\\nI have since submitted a new IDR application and selected the option to exit forbearance, but I want to ensure : My qualifying payment count is restored and continues uninterrupted. \\n\\nThe forbearance is not extended or reapplied. \\n\\nAidvantage is held accountable for failing to respond or provide transparency regarding my account changes. \\n\\nI am less than 10 months from forgiveness and this situation has caused unnecessary stress and delays. I am requesting the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assist in securing an immediate resolution., I requested to be placed on the XXXX plan and was placed on forbearance. During this wait period, I was emailed a statement saying that my interest would now be 0 % pending the review for my application until next year. Fast forward a few months later, I'm still collecting interest on my principal balance and now it's as if I had made no payments at all! Some loans were paused but some were still steadily accruing while the forbearance period hasn't ended yet. I'm at a lost and don't know where I can go to get help for this. It doesn't feel right because I had let my guard down after receiving that letter, that I can finally rest for a bit from repayment but this has been a true nightmare for me. I'd like to get back on repaying as soon as possible, please help!, Im writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the status of my student loans and the lack of communication from these offices. \\n\\nCurrently I have 10 loans. \\nOver the past week and a half, I have sent two emails and attempted multiple times to reach a representative by phone tp Mohela. Unfortunately, Ive been met with long hold times ( ranging from XXXX to XXXX XXXX ) and disconnections either dropped calls or being stuck in the automated phone system. On the one occasion I did manage to speak with someone, the call was abruptly disconnected before I could even ask my question. \\n\\nAdditionally, I recently received a bill for {$480.00}, starting in XX/XX/year&gt;, despite being on the SAVE Plan. According to the official guidance published on StudentAid.gov, borrowers on the SAVE Plan are currently in a general forbearance, which was extended on XX/XX/year&gt;, with repayment not expected to resume until XX/XX/year&gt;, and first payments not due until XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\n\" Under this general forbearance, you do not have to make your monthly payments on your student loans, interest is not accruing, and time spent does not provide credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) or IDR. Servicers expect to complete the necessary technical updates to be ready to begin moving borrowers back into repayment no earlier than XX/XX/year&gt;. '' Given this guidance, Im unclear as to why I am being billed at this time and why my account status does not reflect the general forbearance. I have not received any clarification or updates despite multiple attempts to reach your teams. \\n\\nI kindly request that someone from your support team review my account immediately and provide an update regarding : Why I received a bill under the current forbearance. \\nWhen my account will be properly updated to reflect the SAVE Plan status. \\nWhy I have not received any responses to my prior inquiries., I received a letter stating \" On XX/XX/XXXX, a federal court issued a stay preventing the Department of Education ( ED ) from operating the Saving on a Valuable Education ( SAVE ) Plan. As a result of this ruling, ED has directed Nelnet to put your account into a forbearance. While you are in this forbearance no payment is required on your account and your interest rate will be set to 0 %. This means no interest will accrue while you are in the forbearance. If you made or make a payment for the month ( s ) you are in the forbearance, the amounts paid will go toward satisfying your future payment ( s ). \" As of XX/XX/XXXX, my account continues to accrue interest. \\n\\nAlso, the website has not provided monthly statements since XX/XX/XXXX showing current balance and what payments were applied., Unfortunately, I have found that I was taken advantage of by a textbook example of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPBs 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I contacted XXXX repeatedly due to financial hardship. Rather than informing me of my eligibility for income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federal loan rehabilitation program ( per servicer obligations under Title IV of the Higher Education Act ), I was steered into a series of long-term forbearances. Customer service representatives pressed that I qualified for \" XXXX dollar payments '' and that there were no consequences, and no other options were provided to me. \\n\\nWhen the forbearance expired around XXXX, I was contacted and told that unless I could afford an exorbitant paymentunaffordable at the timemy only option was consolidation. I was NOT told about IDR or rehabilitation, both of which I later discovered would have preserved my balance, avoided interest capitalization, and maintained progress toward loan forgiveness. \\n\\nAs a result of this coercive consolidation by XXXX, my balance ballooned from ~ {$48000.00} to over {$85000.00}. It capitalized interest and reset my forgiveness clock. Since then, I have made over 151 qualifying IDR payments. \\n\\nCritically, the data shows that I was placed in repeated forbearances at XXXX 's recommendation during my financial hardship. I was not informed that these forbearances would expire or that they could lead to default. When my forbearance period expired, I was contacted by XXXX and told that my only option was to either consolidate or make unaffordable payments in excess of {$500.00} per month. This created a false urgency and removed any meaningful choice-no income-driven repayment ( IDR ) or rehabilitation plans were offered. This tactic aligns with the forbearance steering practices that were cited in the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against student loan servicers. It was at that point, under financial duress and without being informed of legal alternatives, that I was coerced into consolidating, causing irreversible financial harm. \\nThis case represents a textbook instance of forbearance steering, as defined by the CFPB 's 2022 enforcement actions against XXXX and supported by federal regulation ( 34 CFR 682.211 ( f ), 685.205 ( b ) ). During the period from XXXX  to XXXX, XXXX failed to inform me of available income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans or the federally mandated 9-month rehabilitation program, both of which were legal options under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Instead, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance until its expiration, at which point I was pressured into consolidating under the threat of unaffordable monthly payments exceeding {$500.00}. This practice violated servicer obligations and has since been identified by the Department of Education and the CFPB as a systemic failure. My experience directly aligns with the borrower harms being remedied under the IDR Account Adjustment initiative ( XXXX ), which was implemented to address improper servicing, including coerced consolidations and loss of forgiveness progress. \\nThrough modeling and consultation with financial experts, I now understand that if I had entered a rehabilitation plan instead of consolidating, my balance today could be nearly half of what it is now. \\nRehabilitation would have preserved my original loans, minimized interest capitalization, and maintained forgiveness eligibility. I have attached a visual comparison of my current repayment path versus the alternative I was never informed of.\\n\\nAdditionally, I made a good-faith attempt to obtain documentation regarding my original disbursements, at the suggestion of my current servicer, Aidvantage. I was advised that with those documents, a balance review could potentially occur. I contacted the XXXX  XXXX XXXX  Financial Aid Office, but was informed that records were no longer available due to the time elapsed since graduation. Likewise, my prior servicer, XXXX, no longer retains access to these historical records. \\nThis systemic failure to retain critical borrower documentation, compounded by coercive servicing practices, has caused enduring financial harm. I believe this case exemplifies the very forbearance and consolidation steering practices cited in prior CFPB and state attorney general actions against XXXX., On XX/XX/year&gt;, put in a request for deferment since I was laid off from my job at the time and had called to speak with the provider who said they would fax over the documents needed, but didn't. Emailed about the same issue and then was emailed the link. I don't think the deferment ever fully was acknowledged and I was immediately put into delinquency and have been for the last 15 years back and forth with numerous providers which has only racked up interest and overall looming stress., I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, AZ XXXX SSN : XXXX XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To : Sallie Mae XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, DE XXXX RE : Dispute of Unverified Student Loan Accounts Immediate Deletion Requested To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal dispute submitted in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq., concerning the reporting of student loan accounts associated with [ Insert Loan Servicer Name or Account Number ( s ), e.g., XXXX on my credit file. \\n\\nXXXX.

I served honorably for XXXX years and currently work as a federal contractor. Despite my employment, I face substantial financial and emotional challenges directly related to my XXXX and the burden of my student loan debt. \\nThe continuation of these loanseven in forbearancecreates undue hardship. I respectfully request that my student loans be fully XXXX under the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX program or other applicable veteran-based discharge programs. \\nIt is my understanding that veterans with a service-connected XXXX may be eligible for loan discharge through the U.S. Department of Education upon proper verification from the VA. I am seeking CFPB 's assistance in ensuring that my case is reviewed promptly, fairly, and with consideration to my veteran status and ongoing hardships. \\nPaying these loans would impose significant emotional and financial strain, interfering with my ability to maintain a stable and healthy life. As such, I am asking for CFPB 's support in advocating for full discharge of my student loans or, at the very least, providing clear guidance to initiate the appropriate process with my loan servicer ( XXXX ) and the Department of Education. \\nThank you for your time, understanding, and for standing up for veterans like myself. \\n\\nVA XXXX XXXX available upon request., I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \\n\\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \\n\\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law., I would like to understand my XXXX repayment options and have been waiting over 4 months ( 120+ days ) for a response for an Income Drive Repayment ( IDR ) application submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Edfinancial on XX/XX/XXXX, and Edfianical is still unable to provide a processing timeline for the application and states that I am ineligible for a 60 day processing forbearance during the application processing. I believe Edfinancial is incorrect about the processing forbearance ineligibility and that Edfinancial should also be able to provide an approximate timeline of when my XX/XX/XXXX IDR application will be processed., RE : FORMAL DISPUTE INCORRECT LATE PAYMENT REPORTING ACCOUNT XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  To Whom It May Concern, This letter is a formal dispute and demand for immediate correction regarding erroneous information being reported to the credit bureaus on the above-referenced student loan account.\\n\\nYour records reflect that this account was 90 days late XXXX time ( s ), which is entirely false and inaccurate. This student loan was in an approved forbearance/deferment status during the alleged time frame of delinquency. Reporting this account as late while it was legally in forbearance is not only misleadingit is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Department of Education regulations regarding federal student loan servicing and reporting. \\n\\nDEMAND FOR ACTION I hereby demand the following actions be taken immediately : Remove all inaccurate late payment notations ( specifically the 90-day lates ) from this account across all credit bureaus. \\n\\nCorrect the payment history to reflect Pays as Agreed / In Forbearance for the entire disputed period. \\n\\nProvide a written statement confirming the correction has been submitted to Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. \\n\\nVIOLATIONS Reporting late payments on a federally-backed student loan while it is in forbearance constitutes : Violation of FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( a ) Furnishing inaccurate data Violation of the Higher Education Act Misreporting federal student loan status Violation of FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692e False or misleading representations Violation of consumer protection rights under CFPB oversight Each violation is subject to statutory damages under federal law. \\n\\nFINAL WARNING If you fail to take immediate corrective action, I will proceed with the following : File complaints with the CFPB, Department of Education, FTC, and State Attorney General Dispute this item directly with all three credit bureaus under FCRA 611 Retain legal counsel to seek damages for defamation of credit, financial injury, and emotional distress I have maintained records proving the account was never delinquent and was in good standing during the entire disputed period. Continued misreporting will not be tolerated. \\n\\nYou have 15 days to respond with a resolution in writing., In XXXX, I submitted a complaint to XXXX. \\n\\nI was steered into long term forbearance and deferments. Ultimately I defaulted for a few years because I wasn't offered XXXX. I rehabilitated my loans and then was pushed into forbearance I've been paying on these loans in some capacity since XXXX. I've been unable to keep track of who has my loan and what's been done to my loans over the years because I've been shuffled from one company to the other ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Aidvantage ). I have gotten little information regarding the one-time acount review. It has taken months to get contact back regarding my initial requests I have requested numerous updatse. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX XXXX added a message XX/XX/XXXX XXXX AM I am still awaiting a response and resolution to this request. It has been over 1 year since I submitted this request and have not received a response. Please review and respond with adjustments to my account specifically for the illegal and other predatory lending practices for which XXXX was found liable. I am expecting that a one-time account review is done and specific analysis is provide to me to support the adjustments that are made. I have yet to receive a response from XXXX of XXXX. This has been open since XXXX and still has not been resolved. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX added a message XX/XX/XXXX XXXX PM I am still awaiting a response and resolution to this request. It has been over 1 year since I submitted this request and have not received a response. Please review and respond with adjustments to my account specifically for the illegal and other predatory lending practices for which XXXX was found liable. I am expecting that a one-time account review is done and specific analysis is provide to me to support the adjustments that are made. \\n\\n\\nIt has been nearly 18 months with no resolution. Now I have discovered that my information was released in violation of FERPA. I am requesting a full discharge of my loans due to these violations and failure to provide a MPN, failure to respond to inquiries in a timely manner., I have XXXX XXXX  that are in the process of being discharged due to misconduct by my school. This process is called borrowers defense, and applies to my loans from the XXXX XXXX. I have attached the emails regarding notification of this matter. According to the Department of Education and Nelnet, this process can take many years. In addition, there is no where I can go as the borrower to see the progress or status of this process. During this process, there should be no negative consequences or impact on me as the borrower. Part of the process for the discharge is a refund of all payments made towards the loans. Due to multiple changes in servicers over the years and the fact that my loans were consolidated, there was very little information available about the specifics of these loans from the very beginning of the process. I previously asked Nelnet in late XXXX for a record of all payments and loans- and I was told at that time that the information was unavailable due to the processing of the borrowers defense case. They did inform me that I would be getting a refund of approximately {$600.00}, which is the full amount they said I paid on these loans in over 10 years. I had serious doubts about that amount, but had XXXX recourse to prove otherwise. They informed me that the payment would be coming from the XXXX Treasury and provided instructions on how to sign up for direct deposit through the IRS website. I enrolled in direct deposit, and on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a deposit in the amount of {$690.00} from the XXXX Treasury. Due to not expecting any other payment, I contacted Nelnet and they confirmed that this is the refund for my borrowers defense case. They informed me that the Department of Education would be sending correspondence to confirm this, but nothing was received. I had spent another few hours at this point between calling Nelnet and the Department of Education, and I let it all go assuming itd all be made clear when the process was complete. \\n\\nI enrolled in school for the winter of XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ) with no issues, and all loans were put into a forbearance status due to being a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was eligible for financial aid at this point. I took the next semester off, and began the process to enroll for XXXX XXXX. I am going to a different school, so I had to login to update my XXXX form at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Upon logging into the Department of Education, there was a bold warning about my loans being in default. I immediately contacted the Department of Education - because my loans are absolutely not in default and even if they were, there is absolutely no way they could go from good standing in XX/XX/XXXX to default in XX/XX/XXXX due to the amount of time needed to get into a default status. The Department of Education informed me that Nelnet, as the servicer, of these loans is solely responsible for updating loan status. I was told to contact Nelnet. Upping logging into the Nelnet website, there is no information about any late payments, default status or record of the defaulted loans. They are not even reported on my loan history. I called Nelnet, and I was informed that the process of refunding payments during a loan discharge can put the loan into a erroneous status of default. They informed me that there was nothing they could do about this, and I had to wait for the borrowers defense case to be resolved and all information would be updated and made right at that time. I requested a supervisor, who reiterated that there was nothing they could do and that this was just part of the process. I informed them that due to being in a default status, I can not return to school and obtain XXXX XXXX, and there are serious consequences to my credit report. In addition, when the government returns to wage garnishments in XX/XX/XXXX, my wages will be garnished for a defaulted loan that I dont owe. Nelnet again told me they had no solution, and that I just had to wait. They were unable to provide any specific timeline, but did inform me that it will likely be a year or more before any update is made to my account. They informed me that this is because the Department of Education controls all processing and they generally take 3-5 years in total for a borrowers defense case. \\n\\nI filed a complaint with the XXXX Department of Education to attempt to resolve this matter in early XX/XX/XXXX, however there has been no resolution to date. I have attached records of my Nelnet account, Department of Education account, deposit of refund, and original emails informing me of approval of my borrowers defense case. There is no other correspondence available by either entity, nor any other correspondence sent to me., Inaccurate info regarding forbearance .. with Sallie Mae, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau XXXX. XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding my student loans, as I am currently coming out of forbearance and have noticed some troubling discrepancies with my loan balances and interest rates. \\n\\nOver the years, my loans have been sold several times, which I understand may contribute to some of the confusion surrounding my account. However, I am concerned about the substantial increases in interest rates that I have seen on some of my loans. When I originally took out the loans, the interest rates were set at a standard percentage. However, it appears that these rates have significantly increased, which I believe is unfair and potentially in violation of the original terms of my loan agreements. \\n\\nGiven the financial strain I have faced in trying to keep up with payments, especially during and after forbearance, it is disheartening to see the interest rates skyrocketing and my balances growing despite my efforts to make payments. I find this situation to be unfair, and I believe that my loans should be handled in accordance with the terms originally agreed upon, without unjustified increases in interest. \\n\\nI respectfully request that the CFPB investigate my loans and help ensure that my balances and interest rates are accurate. I am also seeking guidance on what steps I can take to resolve this matter with my loan servicer., I applied for an XXXX in XXXX. It was denied without notice, and without telling me why. I found out about this on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately applied again. However, since I was never told why my first application was denied, I didn't know if I needed to fix or change anything on my second application. After my first application, my loans were automatically put into processing forbearance. After my second application, they were not. I messaged to ask them to please put them into processing forbearance several times ( XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ), and only received generic and irrelevant messages in response. I'm also serving an XXXX term and am eligible for my loans to be in forbearance due to that. I was unable to request this on Mohela 's website because there is no option for it, despite a button that says \" I'm in the military or public service - volunteer for a nonprofit, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. '' When you click that button, it takes you to a page where the only option is military service. I was able to apply through XXXX, and it took them XXXX days to approve the request, but when they did they only approved it for XXXX of my loans. I want them ALL in forbearance. In the meantime, due to the processing pause on XXXX applications, their website had a notification that said, \" If you have an IDR application that has not been processed within XXXX days and have an unpaid bill within XXXX days of the due date, MOHELA will automatically place a processing forbearance as directed by Federal Student Aid to your account. No action is required by you. '' This applies to me. So I was waiting for my loans to be put into forbearance but they never were. My bill was well over ten days past due, and still nothing. I paid the bill out of fear for my credit score, but this is completely unacceptable. If no action is required by me, why am I having to message them twice about it ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) only for nothing to happen? I have sent them five messages total ( on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ) about this whole fiasco, and have never had a helpful response, if I received one at all. The three responses I have gotten ( the dates of which I'm unsure of because they don't contain a timestamp, which at this point feels purposeful and malicious ) have been an obviously copy and pasted default answer in response to the words \" XXXX '' or \" forbearance '' and do not at all relate to my specific questions and situation. I've also tried calling, but have never been able to connect with a real person, just an unhelpful robot. I work full time and I don't have time to sit on hold for hours on end. I submitted a complaint to XXXX, who said they would respond within XXXX  days, but today is day XXXX and I have reached my limit of what I'm willing to deal with. This is the absolute worst company I have every had the displeasure of working with. Their customer service is non-existent, and they do not follow through with the claims they make on their website. The stakes here are very high, and they continue to drop the ball and they can not be trusted. I can no longer find the notification on their website about the XXXX application that hasn't been processed in XXXX days. It's been replaced with one that says \" Borrows that have a pending IDR application may also be placed on a forbearance until no later than XX/XX/XXXX. '' So which one is it? They can not claim to be automatically putting loans into forbearance in one notification, and then say that it's only a possibility in another one. I'm glad I took a screen shot of the first notification, otherwise I wouldn't have any proof of this. I understand that this is a stressful and uncertain time for federal loans, but it is completely unacceptable to leave me in this situation., Since my husband lost his job in XX/XX/year&gt;, I have been attempting to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan to adjust my monthly payments based on my current financial situation. Despite submitting all required documentation, Aidvantage has failed to process my request for more than a year, leaving me in financial distress. I have made multiple attempts to follow up with customer service, yet my application remains unprocessed. This negligence has resulted in unnecessary financial hardship, and I request immediate action to consolidate my loans and approve an income driven repayment plan that retroactively protects me from late fees, accrued interest, and credit impacts since filing my request on XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\nAdditionally, I seek clarification on how past policy changes, including XXXX XXXX  suspension of income-based repayment plans, have affected my ability to enroll in an IDR plan. The lack of clear communication regarding these policy changes has made it difficult for borrowers like myself to navigate repayment options effectively., I have already complained about my student loan servicer Aidvantage in XXXX. I was supposed to have been placed in a XXXX interest forbearance at that time, and since then I have been making payments but my balance owed has actually gone up. Attempts to ascertain the reason for this have been fruitless, including inexplicably being disconnected from chat due to \" being idle for too long '' although I was not idle. I just want to know that my payments are being received and are applied to the balance owed in a fair manner and it is extraordinarily difficult to figure this out compared to any other financial institution I have worked with. The previous complaint resolution mentioned that payments made during forbearance will count toward future payments, does this mean my account balance remains unchanged even as I make payments? Do I have the option to apply these payments directly to principle? Why has my balance owed increased?, I am pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness and have made XXXX qualifying payments, including during the pandemic forbearance period which the Department of Education stated would count toward PSLF. I worked full-time for qualifying employers from XXXX and submitted employment certifications through the PSLF Help Tool. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I was told I qualified for forgiveness. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX, my loans have not been discharged. I also discovered an IDR application was submitted on my behalf without consent, which may have affected my PSLF count. I contacted my servicer ( Edfinancial ) but was told conflicting information about my forgiveness status and the impact of the forbearance months. I also submitted a complaint to the Department of Education, but it was closed without resolution or clear explanation.\\n\\nI am requesting a review of my PSLF eligibility, confirmation that the pandemic forbearance months were properly credited, and immediate processing of the forgiveness I qualified for in XXXX., I've requested the following information on several occasio over the past 10 years, no response has ever been provided nor were supporting documents received. \\n\\n-A copy of the original Master Promissory Note ( MPN ), signed by me, to establish the lawful origination of the alleged debt. \\n\\n-A full Chain of Custody/Assignment of Servicing Rights , detailing every transfer of ownership or servicing authority from the original lender to XXXX, including dates and legal documentation. \\n\\n-Proof of XXXX legal authority to service and report this loan account, especially in light of the recent restructuring and transfer of federal student loan servicing contracts. \\n\\n-A full and complete payment history ledger, including all forbearances, deferments, interest accruals, and payments since the loan 's origination. \\n\\n-Documentation of compliance with applicable federal laws, including but not limited to the Higher Education Act, Truth in Lending Act, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act., Dear CFPB Complaints Team, I am writing to provide supporting documentation for my student loan servicing complaint filed via the Consumer Complaint Portal regarding XXXX 's handling of my federal loans during the period from approximately XXXX to XXXX. \\n\\nIn my complaint, I described how I contacted XXXX XXXX ( and later XXXX ) multiple times during this period seeking repayment assistance. Rather than being guided into income-driven repayment ( IDR ) plans, I was repeatedly placed into forbearance without being informed of my other options. This resulted in significant capitalized interest and long-term financial hardship. \\n\\nAfter eventually discovering IDR options on my own, I enrolled in a plan but only after substantial delay and misinformation. This experience closely mirrors the borrower harm described in the CFPB 's past actions and state AG settlements with XXXX. \\n\\nAttached is a XXXX XXXX that includes : - My formal written request for case review - Emails and documents from XXXX to XXXX confirming my loan history with XXXX XXXX and XXXX - My signed XXXX IBR application with XXXX XXXX - Evidence of poor servicing support and lack of clear guidance regarding IDR or forgiveness options Thank you for your time and for reviewing my complaint.

              "      <td>[Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., I'm fortunate that my current financial position allows me to be able to handle the increased payment amount, but I am sure there are likely many borrowers who are not in the same position. The re-amortization should have occurred once the forbearance ended to reduce the impact to borrowers., There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. I am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., Our own direction of Human Resources has noted other teachers with the same issue. It appears as though that EdFinancial is deliberately trying to stall in order for borrowers to give up., The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. You have been formally notified., I have provided documentation relating to my loan on three different occasions. The documentation relates to a {$5000.00} teacher loan forgiveness. The last documentation I provided was from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, being the third time theyve submitted paperwork showing that Ive been a certificated teacher with them since XXXX. EdFinancials form provides for only ONE entry and they wanted to know every school I worked for within the district with dates and locations. So our HR was kind enough to provide separate EdFinancial forms for each of the schools I worked at from XXXX  to present, despite that not being necessary. I once again got a rejection letter that my documents are not complete. When Ive tried to speak with them on the phone, they give me the run around and cant properly explain why their form has room for only one entry., I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. Instead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. When I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. Aidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me., I am devastated. I would like to report a situation with my student loans. I recently found out my loans were in default. I have never been in default with my student loans. They notified me on my email instead to mail that I was delinquent. Needless to say I had nine accounts that went 90 days past due and dropped my score over XXXX points. I have Aid Avantage and I did not know who the servicer was until I reviewed my credit report. I would like for them to remove the past due notice off of all 9 accounts. I was denied a student loan for my daughter and we dont know what we are going to do because of it. Also there have been 2 credit card closures from my credit because of this., Illegal Student Loan Reporting &amp; Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment I am filing a formal complaint against [ Loan Servicer Name ], XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. 1.

The Department is not responsible for ensuring that credit repositories or credit bureaus update their information in a timely fashion, but such agencies must comply with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, or FCRA, ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ). \\nThe Department is required to report defaulted debts to credit reporting agencies as referred for collections. If a previous servicer of your debt reported information to credit reporting agencies, that information may still appear on your credit report. You should contact the previous servicer if you have concerns regarding information that they reported. \\nThe FCRA allows consumers to contest information contained in their credit files at a credit bureau. To do so, send the credit bureau a written notice explaining the matter you dispute. The bureau must then investigate the accuracy of that information and correct any inaccurate information. If they do not receive verification or correction of the disputed information within 30 days, they must delete it. Consumers may also have the credit bureau include in later credit reports that the information is disputed. \\nTo dispute information you believe is inaccurate, send to the credit bureau whose credit report you dispute and also to the XXXX credit repositories a letter that states : I dispute the following information on my credit report about the defaulted Federal education debt owed to the U.S. \\nDepartment of Education and that then describes the information you believe is inaccurate.Page XXXX The XXXX credit repositories are : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Im reaching out because I urgently need legal help regarding what I believe to be a predatory and deceptive student loan consolidation that has dramatically inflated my original student loan debtwithout my full understanding, knowledge, or consent. \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I attended college and borrowed a total of approximately {$6600.00} in student loans XXXX XXXX and XXXX ).

Their actions have resulted in significant financial harm by inaccurately reporting my loan as more than 90 days delinquent despite my deferment approval. \\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, XXXX approved me for a six-month deferment on my student loan. Mohela took over my loan on XX/XX/year&gt;, but failed to honor this agreement. Instead, they reported my account as delinquent, severely damaging my credit score and financial standing.\\n\\nIssues with Mohelas Handling of My Loan : 1. Inaccurate Credit Reporting : Mohela falsely reported my account as more than 90 days past due, even though my loan was in an approved deferment period.\\n\\n2.

As a result, I have reason to believe these student loan entries are either inaccurate, fraudulent, or processed without my full and informed consent. \\n\\nIn accordance with my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), I am requesting the following : Immediate investigation into the validity and origin of the student loan ( XXXX ) reported under my name. \\n\\nComplete removal and deletion of any and all related student loan entries from my credit report during this dispute process. \\n\\nWritten confirmation of the deletion and an explanation of how this breach impacted my personal account. \\n\\nI am also requesting all records and documentation you have on file associated with these loans, including the application, any forbearance or repayment history, and evidence of my consent or authorization. \\n\\nGiven the sensitivity and urgency of this issue, I expect a response within 30 days as required by law.

These accounts include all loanssubsidized, unsubsidized, and Parent PLUSand their continued presence on my report constitutes an egregious violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection law. It has come to light through extensive reporting and insider disclosures that entities affiliated with or under the operational influence of XXXX XXXX, specifically DOGE-related ventures, gained illegal and unrestricted access to sensitive borrower data stored within Department of Education systems. This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. The unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. Furthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S., Illegal Student Loan Reporting &amp; Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment I am filing a formal complaint against [ Loan Servicer Name ], XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. 1.

If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly.

Fast forward a few months later, I'm still collecting interest on my principal balance and now it's as if I had made no payments at all! Some loans were paused but some were still steadily accruing while the forbearance period hasn't ended yet. I'm at a lost and don't know where I can go to get help for this. It doesn't feel right because I had let my guard down after receiving that letter, that I can finally rest for a bit from repayment but this has been a true nightmare for me. I'd like to get back on repaying as soon as possible, please help!, I have the SAVE plan with Nelnet. I have a letter from them dated XX/XX/XXXX, saying that my XXXX XXXX are now in forberance.

On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., Hi, I was enrolled in the SAVE plan in 2023 for my student loans through EdFinancial Services, and because of my current income, my payments were {$0.00} per month. I was told that since my payments were {$0.00}, that I did not have to make a payment and that interest was technically accumulating, but it was being covered by the government. I now checked on my loan website again, and now it says that I owe an additional ~ $ XXXX. I called and they said that if I had made a payment of even {$1.00} per month, that the interest would have been covered, but since it was XXXX, that it was not covered. I would like to dispute this, as my student loan provider lied to me and gave me false information. Had this information been offered from the beginning, I would have tried to pay something each month. Now I owe an extra $ XXXX. I also tried to call and file a complaint and to see if I could retroactively pay or resolve this peacefully ; however, I was not allowed to speak to someone regarding the complaint, and I was unable to get a phone number or other contact information. \\n\\nThe person who I just spoke to today was helpful and his employee number is XXXX.

I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\\n\\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \\n\\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \\n\\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\\n\\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments., I have been really confused about how my student loans have been handled since XX/XX/XXXX. My loans have been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. I was on IBR Plan until XX/XX/XXXX, when I was told to switch to SAVE Plan by my servicer EDFinancial. I was thrown into forbearance status XX/XX/XXXX, with no clear explanation, or options given. I read in XX/XX/XXXX that I should be allowed to go back on IBR Plan. I tried to switch back to IBR, and not be in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. I called EDFinancial and asked about going back to IBR XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out. I received an email notification from student aid.gov that said IDR apps would start getting processed again to contact your servicer, I believe this was around XX/XX/XXXX. I logged onto student aid.gov XX/XX/XXXX, and notice the graph for the IDR plan forgiveness payments had disappeared from my account homepage. I called students.gov, and she denied knowing anything about what IDR forgiveness info I was talking about, she told me to call my servicer for information on my loans. She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ). This doesnt seem legal. Its really confusing bouncing back and forth between the Dept of ed ( students.gov ) and EDFinancial. I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX. Ive been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. My eldest was born that year, and now as a single mother, I am trying to get him into university this fall. This is really stressful. Thank you., XX/XX/XXXX : Spoke to a customer service representative and was informed that my loans were in XXXXadministrative ' forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and would stop accumulating interest at that time as the SAVE plan would take effect. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX : Spoke to customer service representative regarding the current status of my loans. \\nI am enrolled in the SAVE plan, therefore my loans should be in forbearance and there should NOT be any interest accruing - per ( https : //studentaid.govXXXX  ). My loans ARE accruing interest and the representative was unable to give an explanation as to WHY or if the interest is going to be removed from the principal at some future date. \\n\\nI applied for the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. My loans on the Edfinancial website are listed as being part of the SAVE plan., In XX/XX/XXXX ( CFPB ID : XXXX ) I asked why my SAVE application was not processed AND/OR PLACED IN FORBEARANCE WITH NO INTEREST ACCRUAL. On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \\n\\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \\n\\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \\n\\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \\n\\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., I am a student loan borrower with the servicer Aidvantage. I have been enrolled in the XXXX plan since before the forbearance due to the injunction. However, due to errors on their end, Aidvantage has not placed some of my direct loans into forbearance and interest has still been accruing even though I have been enrolled in the XXXX plan and the interest should have been set to 0 % from the forbearance period. I have attempted to call them to remedy this situation but they have been unresponsive., I believe there are multiple errors in calculating my accrued interest by XXXX, my former loan servicer and AidVantage, my current loan servicer. I formally entered the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. My loan was then transferred from XXXX to AidVantage on XX/XX/XXXX. Even if the ending accrued interest amount was correct leaving XXXX ( which I would like to verified as I believe it is incorrect ), the amount of accrued interest that appeared in AidVantage after the transfer was different ( and higher ) then what was last documented in XXXX. I believe there was an error that occurred in the transfer process, and erroneous interest was added. The amount of accrued interest on my current AidVantage account is different then when it entered ( again, on SAVE plan so there should be no additional interest ). AidVantage is also charging me erroneous interest. I have documentation of the following details : XXXX Account XXXX : Outstanding Accrued Interest to date, based on issued statements/date billed : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$740.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$80.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} ( how did it jump up so much compared to prior statement? ). \\no XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} ( last statement available ) Total Interest paid in XXXX to XXXX : {$1700.00} ( based on XXXX form from XXXX ) Payments made to XXXX : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$570.00} ( don't have documentation of when received ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$620.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1200.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) Total of {$2400.00} ( all made in XXXX ) Aid Vantage Account Information XX/XX/XXXX loan Transferred to AidVantage o No Interest Accruing on account since XX/XX/XXXX when established o Entering principal Balance of {$110000.00} plus {$1300.00} unpaid interest = {$110000.00} total is what is documented.. \\nCurrent accrued interest is {$1800.00} and total balance is {$110000.00} Total Interest paid in XXXX to AidVantage based on 1099-E : {$87.00} ( how is this possible if I didn't make a payment in XXXX? ). \\n\\nSummary : -last documented accrued interest at XXXX was {$1100.00} ( I dont believe this is accurate ) -documented accrued interest at AidVantage when the transfer was finalized : {$1300.00} ( why is there a difference in the transfer when Im on SAVE plan? ) -Current accrued interest on AidVantage {$1800.00} ( why has it gone up when Im on the SAVE plan? ) I have documentation of all of the above information., On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying my credit score dropped. When I opened my banking app, I saw that my credit dropped XXXX points overnight. I saw that the Department of Education was named on the loans, so I called the Dept. of Ed. on the XXXX. I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : \" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX. We have included a copy of the Welcome Letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. '' This portion of the letter does not clarify the address to which the Welcome Letter was sent. I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. \" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. '' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due. I have previously requested dates of contact, proof of the addresses used to reach me, and evidence of my acknowledgment of the billing statements. \" Per your promissory note, it is your responsibility to update your contact information to ensure that you receive important communications regarding your student loan account. '' I would like to emphasize that I was unable to update my contact information on an account I was unaware of, nor did I know that such a website existed for this purpose. Finally, the latest response I received claimed to attach a Master Promissory Note stating my responsibility to make payments despite never receiving a bill. The Master Promissory Note was never attached to the response. I have never seen this Master Promissory Note and have yet to receive such a document from the company., I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \\n\\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \\n\\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \\n\\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \\n\\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \\n\\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \\n\\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \\n\\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \\n\\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \\n\\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \\n\\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\\n\\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \\n\\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\\n\\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \\n\\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\\n\\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX]</td>\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans. As advised on XX/XX/XXXX, we are unable to process the plan due to the court injunction. Youre welcome to call us at XXXX, with any questions you may have concerning this issueXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Given the updates made by the government, my application should have been placed on forbearance until new recertification amounts could have been made, which is what I stated in my previous complaint XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; I believe Aidvantage intentionally did not place me in forbearance ( with no interest accrual after 60 days ), and am requesting for them to now follow up on the application that I submitted back in XX/XX/XXXX, to place me in general forbearance with no interest accrual. It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., On XX/XX/year&gt; my student loan account showed interest was accruing when it SHOULD NOT be under the SAVE plan. I inquired with Nelnet via email. That same day I received a response I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. After reviewing your account, it appears that interest might still be accruing. We are aware of this issue and working to make an adjustment. We expect this to be updated in XXXX. Today, XX/XX/year&gt;, my student loans are still showing interest accruing. I have not received any follow up regarding this issue, no corrections have been made to my account, and my balance continues to go up. I should not have to pay more because of this error and this should have been promptly corrected months ago., I have the SAVE plan with Nelnet. I have a letter from them dated XX/XX/XXXX, saying that my XXXX XXXX are now in forberance. In the letter, it says \" While you are in this forbearance no payment is required on your account and your interest rate will be set to 0 %. This means no interest will accrue while you are in the forbearance. '' On my XXXX XXXX account, it says I have unpaid accrued interest through XXXX XXXX, XXXX : {$160.00}, I requested to be placed on the XXXX plan and was placed on forbearance. During this wait period, I was emailed a statement saying that my interest would now be 0 % pending the review for my application until next year. Fast forward a few months later, I'm still collecting interest on my principal balance and now it's as if I had made no payments at all! Some loans were paused but some were still steadily accruing while the forbearance period hasn't ended yet. I'm at a lost and don't know where I can go to get help for this. It doesn't feel right because I had let my guard down after receiving that letter, that I can finally rest for a bit from repayment but this has been a true nightmare for me. I'd like to get back on repaying as soon as possible, please help!, Hi, I was enrolled in the SAVE plan in 2023 for my student loans through EdFinancial Services, and because of my current income, my payments were {$0.00} per month. I was told that since my payments were {$0.00}, that I did not have to make a payment and that interest was technically accumulating, but it was being covered by the government. I now checked on my loan website again, and now it says that I owe an additional ~ $ XXXX. I called and they said that if I had made a payment of even {$1.00} per month, that the interest would have been covered, but since it was XXXX, that it was not covered. I would like to dispute this, as my student loan provider lied to me and gave me false information. Had this information been offered from the beginning, I would have tried to pay something each month. Now I owe an extra $ XXXX. I also tried to call and file a complaint and to see if I could retroactively pay or resolve this peacefully ; however, I was not allowed to speak to someone regarding the complaint, and I was unable to get a phone number or other contact information. \\n\\nThe person who I just spoke to today was helpful and his employee number is XXXX. I'm pretty sure when I called in XX/XX/year&gt; and was given this false information, they refused to give me their employee IDs, I discovered on XX/XX/XXXX that interest had improperly accrued on my account. I received a letter from MOHELA ( attached ) on XX/XX/XXXX that my loans were placed into administrative forbearance and would be set to an interest rate of 0 % due to an inability to process my SAVE application. I have a total of XXXX loans. XXXX were correctly set to an interest rate of 0 % but XXXX of them were not. Loan XXXX has been continuing to charge interest at a rate of 5.300 % and Loan XXXX has been continuing to charge interest at a rate of 6.280 %. As of today, they have improperly collected a total of {$3900.00} of interest. This interest charge violates the program 's terms, which were implemented to protect borrowers from unnecessary debt accumulation. \\n\\nShortly after discovering the interest charge, I contacted MOHELA. A representative assured me that the interest would be removed. However, the charge remains on my account. Additionally, when I spoke with a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX, they could not explain the origin of the interest charge and promised that it would be corrected, which never occurred. \\n\\nIn response to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX siding in favor of a lawsuit challenging the SAVE program, Education Secretary XXXX XXXX stated on XX/XX/XXXX, that borrowers enrolled in the SAVXXXX plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance. Despite this guarantee, interest has continued to accrue on my account. \\n\\nThese actions may violate federal laws and regulations, including : The Higher Education Act of 1965, which governs student loans and protects borrowers rights. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits unfair debt practices. The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which ensures accurate loan terms disclosure. \\n\\nMOHELA has not provided adequate documentation or a clear explanation for the improper interest charges, leaving me without a resolution., Since the SAVE program federal injunction, my loans were supposed to be placed on interest-free forbearance until the courts fixed the problem. Currently my loans have been accruing interest since XXXX so my loan servicer has not complied with federal mandates., In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved.]</td>\n",

On XX/XX/XXXX - the company replied with the following : Thank you for reaching out to the CFPB with your concerns regarding your federal student loan account. We understand you are concerned that your newly consolidated loan has not been enrolled in the SAVE plan. You also stated that when you contacted Aidvantage we were unable to advise why the loan hasnt been enrolled in the plan. However, our records show that when you called Aidvantage on XX/XX/XXXX you were correctly advised that due to a Federal court issued injunction the U.S. Department of Education is prevented from implementing parts of the SAVE Plan and other IDR Plans.

It has been over 60 days with interest accruing, and the SAVE application should now be in forbearance since I applied and it was never processed. The government states : As of XX/XX/XXXX, borrowers may apply for the following IDR plans : Pay As You Earn ( PAYE ), SAVE ( previously known as REPAYE ), Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ), and Income-Contingent Repayment ( ICR ), if borrowers meet any plan specific eligibility requirements.. For borrowers who would prefer to make payments during this time -- such as borrowers pursuing PSLF or low-income borrowers who would owe no monthly payments -- enrolling in PAYE or ICR may be an option to consider. Borrowers are still permitted to apply for the SAVE plan ( previously known as REPAYE ), even though the court has enjoined some of the SAVE and other IDR plan provisions, including forgiveness. The Department is working with servicers and contractors to update their systems to align with the terms of the SAVE plan, based on the terms of the injunction. This process will take several months. Ultimately, the terms of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans are subject to the outcome of ongoing litigation. If servicers need time to process a borrowers IDR application, servicers will move the borrower into a processing forbearance for up to 60 days. Interest accrues during this short-term processing forbearance, and time in the processing forbearance that does provide IDR and PSLF credit. If the borrowers application is not processed by their servicer within 60 days, the borrower will be moved into a general forbearance that does not count toward PSLF or IDR until their application is processed. Interest will not accrue in this general forbearance. \\nXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  This was supposedly \" resolved '' by the company in my last CFPB complaint - but I recently received a notification stating my account is being removed from forbearance ( 0 % interest and no payments until more information is available ) effective XX/XX/XXXX - even though forbearance has largely been extended to all SAVE applicants and enrollees due to the current changes made by the administration., I requested to be placed on the XXXX plan and was placed on forbearance.

I was told that since my payments were {$0.00}, that I did not have to make a payment and that interest was technically accumulating, but it was being covered by the government. I now checked on my loan website again, and now it says that I owe an additional ~ $ XXXX. I called and they said that if I had made a payment of even {$1.00} per month, that the interest would have been covered, but since it was XXXX, that it was not covered. I would like to dispute this, as my student loan provider lied to me and gave me false information. Had this information been offered from the beginning, I would have tried to pay something each month. Now I owe an extra $ XXXX. I also tried to call and file a complaint and to see if I could retroactively pay or resolve this peacefully ; however, I was not allowed to speak to someone regarding the complaint, and I was unable to get a phone number or other contact information. \\n\\nThe person who I just spoke to today was helpful and his employee number is XXXX. I'm pretty sure when I called in XX/XX/year&gt; and was given this false information, they refused to give me their employee IDs, Complaint : Drastically increased my monthly payment, not approving IDR applications, and screwing up a refund for four months. \\n\\nAs of XX/XX/XXXX my student loan balance was {$36000.00}, and I was making {$200.00} monthly payments for years. I went back to school in XX/XX/XXXX and went on In-School Deferment.\\n\\nIn-School Deferment sends XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX = {$50000.00}. \\n\\nOnly a few days before XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage says I have {$750.00} due on that day as my first payment. Begrudgingly I pay via XXXX as I don't want my count to go delinquent. I call Aidvantage and ask why this amount is so large compared to what I am historically used to paying. They have no answer and can't lower it. I apply for SAVE plan at this time. They confirmed I provided all documents and just need to wait for approval. They do NOT put me on another forbearance due to my application. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I get an email notification saying my account is delinquent, and that I owe {$240.00} right now, despite paying {$750.00} via XXXX, and balance owed was XXXX just XXXX days prior. I manually pay {$240.00}, and then I call in an ask why this happened. They have no answer and never give me an answer. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on XXXX application status. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I pay {$750.00} again via XXXX, no news on SAVE application status. I call in and ask the status of my SAVE application. They can not find my application until I give them specific dates, and miraculously they find my application. They then tell me that they didn't receive any of my require income documentation despite my sending in months prior and being told it all looks good. Because of this, my original application was never considered. I am angry, I provide them with Income docs, and they restart my application. They put me on a two month application forbearance at this time. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my forbearance ends. Next day I see I owe now {$980.00} per month starting in THREE DAYS!!! Three days advanced notice of another wild price jump. I immediately cancel XXXX as I do not trust it due to earlier problems. I manually pay {$980.00} and it is applied to my account on the XX/XX/XXXX due date. However, also on XX/XX/XXXX, Aidvantage takes {$760.00} from my bank account via XXXX, despite cancelling XXXX a week prior!!! So now they have a total of {$1700.00} payment from me for month of XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI call Aidvantage and complain. It takes XXXX minutes into the call before they even admit to the mistake. I tell them to use that extra payment and apply it to my future account so that I do not owe for next month. They say this is acceptable. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX I notice the {$760.00} completely disappears from my \" Recent Payments '' section in Aidvantage XXXX. Confuse, I call in and they tell me a refund has been issued for {$760.00}. I complain that I didn't want a refund, and they ignored me, but then I say \" whatever '', I will wait for this refund. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account updates saying my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX, and that it is for {$400.00}. I manually pay this amount. Completely frustrated, I call into Aidvantage and ask again for the status of my refund, AND I ask for the status of my SAVE Plan application. They say applications aren't processing right now. As for my refund, they say the original ticket was put in incorrectly and the refund was never issued. They escalate the ticket at this time and I am told the {$760.00} refund process is starting over. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page updates in Aidvantage saying that my next payment is {$960.00}, due on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI am angry at this point and say I don't care about the SAVE plan anymore, and ask if there is another IDR plan they are accepting applications for at this time? I'm told I can try the ICR plan which would bring my monthly payment down to {$600.00} a month. I tell them to cancel my SAVE Plan application, and start a new application for ICR Plan. I provide all of my documents. They put me on a two month NON-interest accruing forbearance while this application is being reviewed. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX, I get notification that my account has update, but instead of my account page saying that I owe {$0.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, I am instead now delinquent and that I owe {$6.00} due NOW. I manually pay this amount. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX my account page says that I owe {$0.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XXXX is XXXX. I do have a new XXXX though saying my forbearance is ending XX/XX/XXXX. No refund received yet for {$760.00}. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX ( today ) I call Aidvantage. I tell them I still have not received my {$760.00} refund which was first initiated XX/XX/XXXX. They research my tickets and now tell me the original refund ticket was put in for {$400.00}, which is wrong. I told them this is not true, otherwise why did {$760.00} disappear from my recent payments. It was clearly approved for refund. The Aidvantage representative can not tell me why the refund hasn't been completed yet, and that they are putting in another escalation for this today, with a processing estimate of another XXXX to XXXX weeks. \\n\\nI also ask the representative for the status of my new XXXX plan application. She tells me that all ICR applications are not being reviewed right now. I say \" Wait, I was TOLD on XX/XX/XXXX that ICR plans ARE being reviewed, and this is the entire reason I cancelled my SAVE plan applcation in the first place. Now I'm being told that this is not true, and that ALL Income-driven repayment plans are on pause, not just SAVE. I was either lied to or given false information, and this caused me to cancel my SAVE application that had been in processing for six months.\\n\\nI am ALSO now told that the two-month non-interest accruing forbearance I was put on these past two month is ACTUALLY an interest accruing forbearance. Another lie told to me on XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nThe current representative tells me that my next payment is due XX/XX/XXXX, but she can not tell me how much it will be. She said the system will automatically put me in forbearance if my newer XXXX plan application hasn't been approved yet, but I know this is a lie. It has never done this before. I'm told if it doesn't do it automatically, that I should call them a week before the XXXX payment is due. \\n\\nBased on history pattern, I fully expect my XX/XX/XXXX payment to now be even HIGHER, and it won't appear on my account until a couple days before it is due. This company is paying with lives, I CAN NOT afford a {$1000.00} payment every month and I'm been attempting to get it lowered for XXXX months now. \\n\\nIf I have to pick between paying mortgage/feeding my child, and paying this XXXX student loan, this student loan is going into default. I don't even XXXX care anymore about my credit. I own everything I need already. Aidvantage does not want to work with me and thinks bullying me into submission via incompetence will just force me to pay higher payments., I have been really confused about how my student loans have been handled since XX/XX/XXXX. My loans have been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. I was on IBR Plan until XX/XX/XXXX, when I was told to switch to SAVE Plan by my servicer EDFinancial. I was thrown into forbearance status XX/XX/XXXX, with no clear explanation, or options given. I read in XX/XX/XXXX that I should be allowed to go back on IBR Plan. I tried to switch back to IBR, and not be in forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX. I called EDFinancial and asked about going back to IBR XX/XX/XXXX. I was told I could, and the woman I spoke with asked my income and household size, said Id get an email. I didnt receive any correspondence from EDFinancial. I got on students.gov account and filled out an IDR app XX/XX/XXXX, requesting to go back onto IBR. That application status is still in review to date. The IDR forgiveness tracker graph on the students.gov account said I had a little over 2 years left of repayment, until I reached enough payments for IDR forgiveness. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and was told all IDR apps were put on hold because of an injunction with SAVE Plan. I asked why IBR was being impacted, since its not SAVE. There are 5 IDR plans, not just SAVE. I received no resolve with my application. Around this time, the IDR application form was removed from the Dept of ED website, which was really concerning. I called EDFinancial XX/XX/XXXX and inquired about my IBR app again. I also requested a copy of my MPN. I called EDFinancial again XX/XX/XXXX as id not received the copy of my MPN, and to ask about my IBR app. I was told theyd mailed the MPN, it was sent out. I received an email notification from student aid.gov that said IDR apps would start getting processed again to contact your servicer, I believe this was around XX/XX/XXXX. I logged onto student aid.gov XX/XX/XXXX, and notice the graph for the IDR plan forgiveness payments had disappeared from my account homepage. I called students.gov, and she denied knowing anything about what IDR forgiveness info I was talking about, she told me to call my servicer for information on my loans. She told me I also had to keep filling out a new IDR app every time they paused and restarting processing the applications. I was in shock a bit. I then called EDFinancial to ask about my IDR app ( again ). A woman spoke with me. I asked if my IDR ( IBR ) app was any closer to being processed. She said theyre behind, and its taking a long time. She told me the apps have been put on hold three times beginning XX/XX/XXXX with the last time they started processing the apps again was XX/XX/XXXX. She put me on hold when I asked what happened to my IDR repayment forgiveness tracker info that was on my students.gov account. She returned, and told me that as of Friday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the Dept of Ed told EDFinancial they were not allowed to discuss IDR forgiveness payments with borrowers. I said that was preposterous, and I asked for a statement of how many months if been in repayment. I was told a statement of my payments would be mailed, and could take up to 15 days. I also asked for a copy of my MPN ( for the third time ). I asked why Id not received it, after asking for it twice already. She said it was mailed to me XX/XX/XXXX. She told me shed ask for another copy of my MPN to get mailed to me, and it would also take up to 15 days. She told me I should be able to see it on my studentaid.gov account. I asked why I can not access it on my EDFinancial account. I can not access it on my students.gov account, either. It says theres no record of my MPN on my studentaid.gov account. I asked her why my IBR application was still not processed as its been almost 3 months since I submitted it. Ive been in forbearance for 9 months when I shouldve been in repayment due to no fault of my own, a court injunction with 1 of 5 available repayment options is causing this issue. I also read that the court may have had an opinion on ICR and PAYE. This still has nothing to do with IBR or PSLF. I can not get a copy of my XXXX from EDFinancial, and it says there is not record of if on my studentaid.gov account. My IDR repayment information has been disappeared from my students.gov account, and I was told by EDFinancial that they could not talk to anyone about IDR forgiveness or payments that had been made to count towards that ( by the DOE on XX/XX/XXXX ). This doesnt seem legal. Its really confusing bouncing back and forth between the Dept of ed ( students.gov ) and EDFinancial. I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX. Ive been in repayment since XX/XX/XXXX. My eldest was born that year, and now as a single mother, I am trying to get him into university this fall. This is really stressful. Thank you., I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. \\n\\nInstead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. \\n\\nWhen I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. \\n\\nAidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me. There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. \\n\\nI am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., I am a student loan borrower with the servicer Aidvantage. I have been enrolled in the XXXX plan since before the forbearance due to the injunction. However, due to errors on their end, Aidvantage has not placed some of my direct loans into forbearance and interest has still been accruing even though I have been enrolled in the XXXX plan and the interest should have been set to 0 % from the forbearance period. I have attempted to call them to remedy this situation but they have been unresponsive., I believe there are multiple errors in calculating my accrued interest by XXXX, my former loan servicer and AidVantage, my current loan servicer. I formally entered the SAVE plan on XX/XX/XXXX. My loan was then transferred from XXXX to AidVantage on XX/XX/XXXX. Even if the ending accrued interest amount was correct leaving XXXX ( which I would like to verified as I believe it is incorrect ), the amount of accrued interest that appeared in AidVantage after the transfer was different ( and higher ) then what was last documented in XXXX. I believe there was an error that occurred in the transfer process, and erroneous interest was added. The amount of accrued interest on my current AidVantage account is different then when it entered ( again, on SAVE plan so there should be no additional interest ). AidVantage is also charging me erroneous interest. I have documentation of the following details : XXXX Account XXXX : Outstanding Accrued Interest to date, based on issued statements/date billed : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$740.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$80.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} ( how did it jump up so much compared to prior statement? ). \\no XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1100.00} ( last statement available ) Total Interest paid in XXXX to XXXX : {$1700.00} ( based on XXXX form from XXXX ) Payments made to XXXX : o XX/XX/XXXX : {$570.00} ( don't have documentation of when received ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$620.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) o XX/XX/XXXX : {$1200.00} ( received XX/XX/XXXX ) Total of {$2400.00} ( all made in XXXX ) Aid Vantage Account Information XX/XX/XXXX loan Transferred to AidVantage o No Interest Accruing on account since XX/XX/XXXX when established o Entering principal Balance of {$110000.00} plus {$1300.00} unpaid interest = {$110000.00} total is what is documented.. \\nCurrent accrued interest is {$1800.00} and total balance is {$110000.00} Total Interest paid in XXXX to AidVantage based on 1099-E : {$87.00} ( how is this possible if I didn't make a payment in XXXX? ). \\n\\nSummary : -last documented accrued interest at XXXX was {$1100.00} ( I dont believe this is accurate ) -documented accrued interest at AidVantage when the transfer was finalized : {$1300.00} ( why is there a difference in the transfer when Im on SAVE plan? ) -Current accrued interest on AidVantage {$1800.00} ( why has it gone up when Im on the SAVE plan? ) I have documentation of all of the above information., On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email saying my credit score dropped. When I opened my banking app, I saw that my credit dropped XXXX points overnight. I saw that the Department of Education was named on the loans, so I called the Dept. of Ed. on the XXXX. I talked to XXXX, asking about the loans, as I was unaware of any more student loans linked to my account because I did not see any loans on my Firstmark Services account where I had been paying off {$30000.00} in student loans. I made my last payment in XXXX of XXXX to pay off the {$30000.00} debt. XXXX told me it could be fraud and suggested I ask for forbearance until I could get the loans disputed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Firstmark Services to see if I could get any information about the other student loans that seemed to be causing the drop in my credit score. I saw no additional or unpaid loans on my Firstmark account. XXXX at Firstmark Services said that the loans causing the issue may be linked to the federal student loan servicer Nelnet. I then called Nelnet to ask about the loans and to verify if they were legitimately my student loans or if this was a case of fraud. XXXX from Nelnet told me the loans were linked to XXXX XXXX and XXXX University, both institutions I attended. She verified the dates the loans were taken out, which match the dates of my attendance. She told me I owe {$33000.00} total according to the Nelnet account. She said {$2800.00} of interest has accrued at this point. I also have late fees attributed to this account, which is why my credit dropped. She said the payments were due on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why I had never received a notification from them. She said they had sent an email, but upon further investigation, we found that the email was incorrect. I asked her why she never sent me a piece of physical mail or called my phone number to inform me about the loans, and she said she could only send an email despite having my home address and phone number. She then told me there was nothing they could do to help me, so I filed a dispute with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX. After filing an initial complaint through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I received a generic response from Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX claiming they had reached out to me via phone and email prior to my payments becoming late. However, the response did not clarify where these emails were sent, or which phone number was called. I request that Nelnet provide proof of these communications, as I had never received any phone calls, emails, or letters from Nelnet until I shockingly discovered my credit score had dropped dramatically last month for what seemed to be no reason. Nelnet had not notified me of the late fees, and I do not know when they would have ever notified me if I had not investigated my credit score issue. By the time I uncovered the cause of my credit score drop, late fees and interest had already accumulated on my loans. Let me be clear : I received no communication from Nelnet until after I filed my complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, and as a result, I had no way of making timely payments on these loans. For context, I can provide proof of my history with Firstmark Services, where I consistently paid my loans on time and early. I can also provide evidence that I have always paid my car payments in full and on time I submit these facts as supporting evidence that I had no access to my student loans held with Nelnet, and if I had, they would have been paid on time. Additionally, since Firstmark is a division of Nelnet, I would also like an explanation as to why Nelnet did not send communications to the active email address associated with my Firstmark Services loans, which were being properly paid. If Nelnet had access to my Firstmark loan information and contact details, it is negligent that they did not use this information to ensure I was contacted through methods I would have received. I am employed and have no intention of avoiding my student loan responsibilities. However, Nelnets failure to provide me with access to my account has led to the accumulation of late fees and interest, significantly impacting my credit score. If I had been able to access my loans, I would have made timely payments, accrued less interest, and avoided these late fees. Nelnet did not respond to my complaint with adequate information and again was negligent in providing me with the information needed to access and pay off my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a new response from Nelnet. Unfortunately, this response failed to address any of the concerns I previously raised. I would like to outline the shortcomings of the response in addressing my claim below : \" XXXX authorized the transfer of your federal student loans from Great Lakes XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to Nelnet, on XX/XX/XXXX. We have included a copy of the Welcome Letter that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. '' This portion of the letter does not clarify the address to which the Welcome Letter was sent. I am requesting the specific address to which this letter was dispatched, as well as confirmation that I received it. Additionally, I want to highlight that the Welcome Letter Nelnet attached to the claim response appears to be from a webpage or email, but there is no proof that it was actually sent to any of my addresses, either physical or email. \" While your loan was in repayment, we sent you billing statements each month. When your account became past due, we also tried to reach you in other ways such as calling and sending both email and postal mail to help bring your account up to date. '' This section fails to specify which email address, phone number, or mailing address was used to contact me during the repayment period and when my account became past due. I have previously requested dates of contact, proof of the addresses used to reach me, and evidence of my acknowledgment of the billing statements. \" Per your promissory note, it is your responsibility to update your contact information to ensure that you receive important communications regarding your student loan account. '' I would like to emphasize that I was unable to update my contact information on an account I was unaware of, nor did I know that such a website existed for this purpose. Finally, the latest response I received claimed to attach a Master Promissory Note stating my responsibility to make payments despite never receiving a bill. The Master Promissory Note was never attached to the response. I have never seen this Master Promissory Note and have yet to receive such a document from the company., Since the SAVE program federal injunction, my loans were supposed to be placed on interest-free forbearance until the courts fixed the problem. Currently my loans have been accruing interest since XXXX so my loan servicer has not complied with federal mandates., I am submitting this complaint regarding unauthorized interest accrual on my XXXX XXXX XXXX  enrolled in the SAVE ( Saving on a XXXX XXXX ) plan. Despite the Department of Education 's explicit guidance that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during the administrative forbearance period, Aidvantage has allowed interest to accrue on my account, resulting in an increase in my loan balance. \\n\\nHere is a summary of the issue and timeline : Department of Education Guidance : The Department of Education mandated that all borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan be placed into an interest-free administrative forbearance beginning XX/XX/XXXX, due to ongoing legal challenges. During this period, no interest was supposed to accrue on loans. \\n\\nAidvantage 's Actions : Aidvantage stated in their letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, that my loans were in a general forbearance with no interest accruing from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, they claim that when I submitted a new Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) application on XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were moved into a \" processing forbearance '' for up to 60 days. During this processing forbearance, Aidvantage allowed interest to accrue on my loans starting XX/XX/XXXX, despite my enrollment in the SAVE plan. \\n\\nWhen my application was not processed within the 60-day window, Aidvantage states that my account was moved back into a general forbearance effective XX/XX/XXXX, during which interest was set to 0 %. \\n\\nImpact : My loan balance increased from {$72000.00} ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) to {$73000.00} as of nowa difference of {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest. \\n\\nThis interest accrual violates the Department of Educations directive that loans under the SAVE plan should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. \\n\\nAttempts to Resolve : I have made over a dozen phone calls to Aidvantage since XX/XX/XXXX, totaling more than 12 hours of time spent trying to resolve this issue. \\n\\nDuring each call, I was promised a supervisor callback within 24-48 business hours, but no supervisor has ever followed up with me. \\n\\nI escalated this issue to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB Complaint # XXXX ), but Aidvantage falsely reported to the CFPB that the issue was resolved when it was not. \\n\\nWhy This Is a Problem : Aidvantages actions are inconsistent with federal regulations and Department of Education mandates regarding the SAVE plan. The Department explicitly stated that borrowers enrolled in SAVE should not accrue interest during administrative forbearance. By allowing interest to accrue during the processing forbearance period ( XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ), Aidvantage has violated these directives. \\n\\nAdditionally : Their explanation in their XX/XX/XXXX letter does not align with federal guidance. \\n\\nTheir failure to follow through on promised callbacks and their false reporting to the CFPB demonstrate systemic issues in their handling of borrower complaints.\\n\\nWhat I Am Requesting : Immediate removal of the {$1300.00} in unauthorized accrued interest from my account. \\n\\nRestoration of my loan balance to {$72000.00} as it was in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nWritten confirmation from Aidvantage detailing these corrections and assurances that no further interest will accrue while my account remains under administrative forbearance as mandated by the Department of Education.\\n\\nAccountability for Aidvantages false reporting to the CFPB and failure to provide adequate customer service. \\n\\nA formal investigation into whether Aidvantage is systematically violating Department of Education mandates regarding SAVE plan borrowers.\\n\\nThis issue has caused significant stress and wasted time due to Aidvantages noncompliance and lack of accountability. I request immediate action from both Aidvantage and federal authorities to resolve this matter fairly and ensure compliance with federal regulations moving forward. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, In a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from my loan servicer telling me that my loan would remain in an administrative forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX and that I didn't need to do anything until XX/XX/XXXX. During the week of XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log into my servicer 's ( Aidvantage ) website, to confirm the date. The dates it shows that my forbearance ends is XX/XX/XXXX, and not XX/XX/XXXX. I called the servicer and was told that my forbearance ended XX/XX/XXXX. I told the representative that I have 3 different dates that the forbearance would end, and I don't know which date was accurate. The representative proceeded to tell me that the XX/XX/XXXX date was accurate. I explained that I had not received any communication telling me that. I asked her if a letter had been sent to me. She said notifications were set up to go to my phone. I asked her why that wasbthe case ask I had been getting notifications via XXXX postal mail and I hadn't requested that it be changed. I asked that she provide the dates notifications were sent to my phone and to provide me with a copy that was said to have been sent to my phone. She said she didn't see that anything had been sent to me. I explained that had I not called or logged into my online account, I would have never known when the Administrative forbearance would end. As it stands I still don't know when my forbearance will end under the SAVE repayment plan. I'm concerned about my credit being negatively affected for the loan servicer 's failure to provide me with accurate notifications of what is to be expected ; therefore, I am asking you for help in getting this matter resolved., I discovered on XX/XX/XXXX that interest had improperly accrued on my account. I received a letter from MOHELA ( attached ) on XX/XX/XXXX that my loans were placed into administrative forbearance and would be set to an interest rate of 0 % due to an inability to process my SAVE application. I have a total of XXXX loans. XXXX were correctly set to an interest rate of 0 % but XXXX of them were not. Loan XXXX has been continuing to charge interest at a rate of 5.300 % and Loan XXXX has been continuing to charge interest at a rate of 6.280 %. As of today, they have improperly collected a total of {$3900.00} of interest. This interest charge violates the program 's terms, which were implemented to protect borrowers from unnecessary debt accumulation. \\n\\nShortly after discovering the interest charge, I contacted MOHELA. A representative assured me that the interest would be removed. However, the charge remains on my account. Additionally, when I spoke with a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX, they could not explain the origin of the interest charge and promised that it would be corrected, which never occurred. \\n\\nIn response to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX siding in favor of a lawsuit challenging the SAVE program, Education Secretary XXXX XXXX stated on XX/XX/XXXX, that borrowers enrolled in the SAVXXXX plan will be placed in an interest-free forbearance. Despite this guarantee, interest has continued to accrue on my account. \\n\\nThese actions may violate federal laws and regulations, including : The Higher Education Act of 1965, which governs student loans and protects borrowers rights. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), which prohibits unfair debt practices. The Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ), which ensures accurate loan terms disclosure. \\n\\nMOHELA has not provided adequate documentation or a clear explanation for the improper interest charges, leaving me without a resolution.]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year&gt;, but nothing else. If i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue., I am devastated. I would like to report a situation with my student loans. I recently found out my loans were in default. I have never been in default with my student loans. They notified me on my email instead to mail that I was delinquent. Needless to say I had nine accounts that went 90 days past due and dropped my score over XXXX points. I have Aid Avantage and I did not know who the servicer was until I reviewed my credit report. I would like for them to remove the past due notice off of all 9 accounts. I was denied a student loan for my daughter and we dont know what we are going to do because of it. Also there have been 2 credit card closures from my credit because of this., There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. I am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., I submitted my annual Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) recertification to Aidvantage on time and in full, using the correct process. My income is approximately $ XXXX/year, which is below 150 % of the federal poverty guideline. Under the SAVE Plan or any valid IDR/IBR plan , this income level qualifies for a $ XXXX monthly payment. Instead, Aidvantage assigned me a $ XXXX/month paymentan amount that is not legally or mathematically possible based on my income. I contacted them and was placed in a two-month administrative forbearance. After that, they returned with the exact same incorrect payment amount. When I pressed for clarification, Aidvantage responded that my IDR application has not been processed yet, even though they had already issued a bill and claimed it was based on a recalculation. This is a clear contradiction. You can not bill a borrower for an IDR plan amount before processing the application. Aidvantage has not requested any additional documentation from me., Illegal Student Loan Reporting &amp; Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment I am filing a formal complaint against [ Loan Servicer Name ], XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. 2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. 3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). I demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action., The federal student loan COVID-19 forbearance program ended in XX/XX/XXXX. However, payments were not re-amortized on my federal student loans currently serviced by Nelnet until very recently. The new payment amount that is effective starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment will nearly double my payment from {$180.00} per month to {$360.00} per month., XX/XX/XXXX I increased the amount to automatically be paid each month from {$790.00} to {$850.00}. The payment showed as paid on the student loan provider ( NelNet ) as of XX/XX/XXXX, but did not clear my XXXXXXXX XXXX account. It is the same bank account I've had associated with the auto debit for years. A few days later I received a notice the payment never went through., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. You have been formally notified., Since auto-payment receives a small discount on the loan payment, I suspect the company of skimming the dollar and change that my payment amount should be reduced by per month. Please assist me in correcting this behavior, so that other borrowers are not informed of an auto-debit only to have these bad actors play games with our loan accounts.]</td>\n",

They were very reluctant to help, refusing to transfer my call to his supervisor and refused to give me his name. When requested he stated no for both, lacking transparency. It wasn't until he could no longer provide relevant information I requested that he granted my transfer to his supervisor. \\n\\nHe informed me the delinquency would be reversed and my account would be reported as current by XX/XX/year&gt; due to my pending IDR application A supervisor, XXXX, confirmed retroactive payment adjustments and provided a timeline of prior contact attempts many of which I never received. \\n\\nI have already filed disputes with XXXX XXXX XXXX and submitted My first complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). \\n\\nThis now the issue I am having with EdFinicial : PSLF Concerns : During the call, XXXX pushed me to consolidate my loans, despite the fact that doing so would cause me to lose all XXXX qualifying PSLF payments already recorded. He also insisted that they, EdFinicial, would still be my loan servicers. This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. \\n\\nViolations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle. They are waiting over a week, despite being current as of today. \\n\\nUnder the Higher Education Act ( HEA ), borrowers in the process of applying for an income-driven plan should not be penalized with negative credit marks or be given misleading servicing advice that jeopardizes PSLF eligibility., Subject : Inaccurate Reporting of Student Loan Status and Failure to Acknowledge XXXX  Progress Complaint : I am filing a complaint regarding the mismanagement of my federal student loans by my servicer, Edfinancial Services. \\n\\nDespite having made XXXX qualifying payments under an Income-Driven Repayment ( XXXX ) plan ( as acknowledged on my loan dashboard ), I am being reported as having XXXX qualifying payments toward XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Additionally, negative marks, including possible delinquency or default, were reported to credit bureaus without adequate notice or opportunity to cure. \\n\\nNo Delinquency Notice Received I was never notified of any late payment, missed payment, or default. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Higher Education Act, I should have been properly informed before any negative credit reporting. This lack of notice is a clear violation of my consumer rights. \\n\\nActively in XXXX &amp; XXXX Process I submitted an XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) application on XX/XX/year&gt;, specifically requesting the lowest monthly payment, which qualifies me for the XXXX plan. I also submitted my XXXX Employment Certification form, signed by my employer. During this time, my loans were under review, and therefore should not have been reported as delinquent. \\n\\nI submitted a dispute with all three major credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) and recently submitted both an XXXX request and a XXXX Employment Certification Form on XX/XX/year&gt;., I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \\n\\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \\n\\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law., XXXXo weeks ago I noticed my credit score dropped XXXX points regarding 90 day late payment on student loans. I including XXXX others I know personally had the same thing happen. My student loans servicer was initially Great Lakes then without informing me loans were transferred to another company. I was not notified when exactly the loans were resumed nor notified that servicer was changed. I had auto payments set up initially under the impression my loans were still being paid on. How can I go about this? This is a lack of government transparency and now millions of Americans are being negatively impacted by it. XXXX unable to make any type of purchase bc of this and currently homeless bc I can not get approved for an apartment due to my credit., In XX/XX/year&gt;, I received a notice from my loan servicer stating that my account was past due and would soon be in default. However, the account contains multiple legal discrepancies and privacy violations that I formally disputed on XX/XX/year&gt;, by sending certified letters to the loan servicer and the U.S. Department of Education. \\n\\nSpecifically, I believe my personal information was disclosed without my consent to unauthorized parties, which violates federal privacy law under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ). I also believe the loan was mishandled, with incomplete and inaccurate information provided to me, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), as well as the Higher Education Act. \\n\\nDespite contacting the company and requesting an investigation, verification of the loan, and resolution, the servicer continues to pursue collection without addressing my formal dispute., In XXXX my student loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX were consolidated into two loans. I was given a discharge but the disch\\narge was applied to the old, empty loans and changed from consolidated to discharged.\\n\\nI contacted both the discharge unit and the loan servicer both who stated the department of education was responsible for accurately reporting loan amounts. I was told by the discharge unit that my loans from XXXX had been forgiven in XXXX which is inaccurate, these loans were consolidated in XXXX, see XXXX statement. \\n\\nThe amount shown on my credit and studentaid.gov portal are inaccurate and the forgiveness has been inappropriately applied., I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance., 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education.\\n\\n2.

              "      <td>[On XX/XX/2020, I endorsed a Direct PLUS Loan for my mother, serviced originally by Nelnet. \\n\\nDuring the federal student loan servicing transition in XXXX, our loan was transferred ( or split ) to XXXX. This was terrible timing as the CARES Act was put into effect on XX/XX/2020 and extended multiple times throughout the years. \\n\\nMy mother did not receive any notification or correspondence regarding the servicer change, which is required by federal regulations. \\n\\nMy sister, who was making the payments, was unaware of the transfer and thus missed payments on the portion managed by NelNet. \\n\\nThese missed payments were reported to the credit bureaus, negatively impacting both my mothers and my credit reports. \\n\\nWe only became aware of the issue upon reviewing our credit reports. \\n\\nMy sister immediately set up autopay to bring the accounts current, but the late payments remain on our credit reports. \\n\\nAs the endorser of this Direct PLUS Loan, I understand that my obligation is to repay the loan if the borrower fails to do so. The Addendum to the Master Promissory Note ( MPN ) that I signed repeatedly states, an endorser is someone who agrees to repay the Direct PLUS Loan if the borrower does not repay the loan. It also specifically notes : If the borrower of a Direct PLUS Loan becomes delinquent in making payments or defaults on the loan, we may also report your name to consumer reporting agencies in connection with the delinquent or defaulted loan. The use of the word may indicates that reporting my name for delinquencies is discretionary, not mandatory.\\n\\nIn my case, the borrower did not default on the loan ; there were only late payments due to a lack of notification during a servicer transition. I was never notified of the delinquency or given an opportunity to bring the account current before negative information was reported on my credit. Given the discretionary nature of reporting as outlined in the MPN, and the fact that I was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to address the situation, I believe it is unfair and inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement to have my credit negatively impacted under these circumstances. \\n\\nI have a strong history of on time payments, and if given the chance and proper communication, I would have kept the account status current, thus preventing any delinquency on my credit report as well as my mother 's., I am writing to formally file a complaint concerning the servicing of my Federal Perkins Loan ( or NDSL/Defense Loan ) by HeartlandXXXX in connection with actions taken by the University of Texas at XXXX XXXX XXXX office . \\n\\nI was recently informed via a letter from the University XXXX XXXX at XXXX that my Federal Perkins Loan has been transferred to the U.S. Department of Education for collection. This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \\n\\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law., I am filing this formal complaint against Aidvantage ( previously Navient ) for failing to execute a lawful loan discharge under the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Adjustment provision, in clear violation of : 20 U.S.C. 1087e ( d ) requiring loan discharge after 240 qualifying payments, and 34 CFR 685.206 obligating servicers to provide accurate information and not obstruct borrower rights.\\n\\nI have made 609 cumulative qualifying payments across 8 federal student loans dating back to XXXX, as detailed below. These include periods of repayment, forbearance, and defermentmuch of which qualifies under the IDR Account Adjustment rules issued by the Department of Education. \\n\\nPayment Breakdown ( based on my account records ) : XXXX Stafford Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Stafford Unsubsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Stafford Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Stafford Unsubsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Unsubsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Unsubsidized : XXXX payments Total : XXXX payments In XXXX, I contacted XXXX/Aidvantage  and explicitly requested my IDR adjustment months count. The representative verbally confirmed that my total payments exceed the XXXX requirement under IDR forgiveness, and that my loans were eligible for full discharge by XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, they also informed me that my discharge has been delayed due to technical limitations and staffing issues, not because of ineligibility. As of today, I am still waiting for this discharge to be honored, despite statutory eligibility.\\n\\nThe Higher Education Act mandates loan forgiveness after 240 payments under IDR plans ( 20 U.S.C. 1087e ( d ) ).\\n\\nFederal regulation ( 34 CFR 685.206 ) requires servicers to uphold borrower rights and not impede lawful discharge. \\n\\nI am now suffering financially and psychologically from an unjust delay that contradicts both the spirit and the letter of the law. Being currently unemployed, and interest continually accruing, it is unlikely that I can ever catch up on paying these loans., I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance., Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting &amp; Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment To Whom It May Concern : I am filing a former complaint against AidVantage, XXXX XXXX and XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\\n\\nComplaint Details : 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. \\n2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment.\\n\\n3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ).\\n\\nI demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action. \\n\\nXXXX DL Consolidated - Subsidized {$22000.00} 4.375 % XX/XX/year&gt; XXXX DL Consolidated - Unsubsidized {$30000.00} 4.375 % XX/XX/year&gt; XXXX Direct Loan - Unsubsidized {$21000.00} 7.050 % XX/XX/year&gt; XXXX Direct Loan - Unsubsidized {$13000.00} 8.080 %, I am writing to dispute inaccurate information appearing on my credit report regarding my student loan account ( s ) with Nelnet. Specifically, I am disputing the reported 90-day late payment status.\\n\\nAt the time the 90-day late notice appeared on my credit report, my loan ( s ) were in forbearance. I did not receive any notification that the forbearance was being lifted or that payments were becoming due. Due to unforeseen and significant personal circumstances, including being in and out of the XXXX  for the XXXX  of my XXXX  and undergoing XXXX XXXX, I was unaware of any change in my loan status. \\n\\nAs a result of this inaccurate reporting of a 90-day late payment, my credit score unfortunately dropped by approximately 150 points. \\n\\nI want to emphasize that the loan is currently completely paid off for Nelnet. While the account is settled, the negative impact of the erroneous 90-day late notice is severely affecting my ability to secure necessary credit. Most urgently, we were in the final stages of closing on a home, and at the last minute, the lender pulled my credit report and we were subsequently denied the loan due to this significant negative mark. The removal of this inaccurate 90-day late notice is the critical factor in improving my credit score and regaining our eligibility for the home. Currently we are scheduled to close on XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\nI request that you immediately investigate this matter and remove the inaccurate 90-day late payment notation from my credit report.\\n\\nPlease notify me of the results of your investigation and the removal of this inaccurate information as soon as possible.\\n\\nThank you for your prompt attention to this critical issue., I was enrolled in automatic payments for my federal student loan prior to the COVID-19 forbearance period. During the pause, auto-debit was suspended. When payments resumed, I was not notified by my servicer that auto-pay would not restart automatically. As a result, I unintentionally missed three payments and was marked 90 days delinquent on my credit report. \\n\\nI brought the account current as soon as I discovered the error. Ive contacted the loan servicer, but they have refused to remove the late payment. I believe this negative mark is the result of a failure in communication and servicer procedures, not intentional nonpayment on my part. I am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in reviewing this matter and encouraging the servicer to make a one-time goodwill adjustment., Good Morning, In XXXX of XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) to apply for a Direct Plus loan. I was told to wait until XXXX of XXXX. When I applied the loXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXRONG date and used school year XX/XX/XXXX instead of XX/XX/XXXX - ( THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Financial Aid in XXXX XXXX after hours and hours on my end trying to figure out what happened! ) As a result and since I did not see the Direct Plus loan on my daughter 's financial aid report I borrowed {$11000.00} AGAIN in XXXX of XXXX. I then began to get emails from Nelnet about the {$22000.00} that I had borrowed. I immediately contacted them to inquire as to the amount and then is when I had to make a many, many phones calls to XXXX and Nelnet to track down the issue. Again, the ERROR was found to be with XXXX and was fully admitted on their part. I was informed that they were returning their mistake ( Loan # 1 ) and that there was no further action needed on my part. As it turned out, my daughter earned additional scholarships and worked thorughout the summer and fall and we did NOT use ANY of the Loan # 2 and I returned all of it in XX/XX/XXXX and have a letter from Nelnet stating that the loan was repaid in full and without penalty because it was within 6 months. \\nLast week, XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating that I owe {$320.00} in principal and interest from Loan # XXXX - XXXX XXXX 's error! I then spent countless hours calling XXXX, XXXX and even the Department of Education to resolve this matter. I was told from Nelnet and Dept of Ed that neither one had control of the loan and to contact the other entity. XXXX ignored my request to discuss the matter and instead sent me this link to file a complain. \\nIn a nut shell, I am being asked to pay {$320.00} for money that was NEVER USED! Yes, the request ( XXXX ) was processed, the first time erroneously and WITHOUT my ever knowing it and the second time I returned it within 2 months! I did my due diligence, I spent hours tracking down their mistake, was told that it was taken care of and yet, I am stuck with a {$320.00} bill for money that NEVER even applied/used/withdrawn etc. \\nPlease help me resolve this! I thought I had taken care of everything and yet, it continues. XXXX has not offered any help even though they are solely responsible and Nelnet keeps telling me they don't have anything to do with the loan which I can not understand their position since they issued the loan! \\nPlease, I am not trying to get away with anything, my wife and I have helped our children ( ironically three of them went to XXXX ) and they have worked their tails off academically and over the summers so that we would never have to borrow money. This was the first and will be the only time that we borrow and it has proven to be nothing but a headache and I feel as though it is not our fault nor should we be asked to repay anything since no money was used. \\nThank you very much for your time and effort on our behalf!, In XXXX my student loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX were consolidated into two loans. I was given a discharge but the disch\\narge was applied to the old, empty loans and changed from consolidated to discharged.\\n\\nI contacted both the discharge unit and the loan servicer both who stated the department of education was responsible for accurately reporting loan amounts. I was told by the discharge unit that my loans from XXXX had been forgiven in XXXX which is inaccurate, these loans were consolidated in XXXX, see XXXX statement. \\n\\nThe amount shown on my credit and studentaid.gov portal are inaccurate and the forgiveness has been inappropriately applied., I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \\n\\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \\nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \\nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \\nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \\nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \\nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \\n\\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \\n\\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \\nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \\nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \\n\\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX]</td>\n",

Misreporting can lead to misunderstandings about my financial responsibility and affect my ability to secure loans in the future.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my concerns. I appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide regarding this matter., Subject : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Servicer Name : Nelnet Loan Account Number : XXXX Type of Loan : Federal 3. Nature of Complaint : Inaccurate reporting to credit bureaus Unlawful collection practices I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/scrub&gt;XXXX I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$58000.00}, despite my payments being up to date. my request for an Income-Driven Repayment Plan was wrongfully denied, despite meeting eligibility requirements. Also it has been unauthorized access to my account which is a direct violation of my privacy., Thank you for reviewing my concerns. I respectfully disagree with the assertion that nothing was reported late on Aidvantages end, as it disregards the core issue : incorrect and inconsistent reporting of my repayment start date. \\n\\nMy final coursework in the University XXXX  Georgia XXXX XXXX program concluded in summer XXXX, and my degree was conferred on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, Aidvantage incorrectly relied on a XX/XX/XXXX graduation date, as reported in an earlier data transfer, and initiated repayment with a due date of XXXX XXXXwithout verifying the updated NSLDS information. This misalignment led to the wrongful early start of my repayment period. \\n\\nI proactively worked with the University of Georgia to correct the record. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Senior Assistant Registrar, confirmed that UGA  manually updated the graduation date in the NSLDS Clearinghouse to reflect my summer XXXX graduation term. This means Aidvantage has access to the correct data and still failed to adjust my grace period or repayment terms accordingly. \\n\\nAidvantages statement that \" there is no negative reporting '' is misleading. While they may not have marked payments as formally delinquent, the incorrect repayment start date has affected the accounts age, status, and monthly payment history, which are critical components of credit scoring models used by mortgage underwriters, financial institutions, etc. The impact is not limited to delinquencyaccuracy matters. \\n\\nDespite calls and emails, including my direct outreach to my assigned representative, XXXX, I have not received confirmation that : Aidvantage received and processed the corrected NSLDS data ; My grace period has been properly reinstated ; My repayment start date has been realigned with the correct graduation date ; My credit file has been updated to reflect these changes. \\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers of credit information have a legal obligation to report accurate and complete information. Whether a late payment is marked or not, the inaccurate reporting of account status, timing, or terms still constitutes a violation of that obligation., In XX/XX/year&gt;, I received a notice from my loan servicer stating that my account was past due and would soon be in default. However, the account contains multiple legal discrepancies and privacy violations that I formally disputed on XX/XX/year&gt;, by sending certified letters to the loan servicer and the U.S. Department of Education. \\n\\nSpecifically, I believe my personal information was disclosed without my consent to unauthorized parties, which violates federal privacy law under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ). I also believe the loan was mishandled, with incomplete and inaccurate information provided to me, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), as well as the Higher Education Act. \\n\\nDespite contacting the company and requesting an investigation, verification of the loan, and resolution, the servicer continues to pursue collection without addressing my formal dispute., In XXXX my student loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX were consolidated into two loans.

I was told by the discharge unit that my loans from XXXX had been forgiven in XXXX which is inaccurate, these loans were consolidated in XXXX, see XXXX statement. \\n\\nThe amount shown on my credit and studentaid.gov portal are inaccurate and the forgiveness has been inappropriately applied., Inaccurate late payments are reporting on my credit report from student loans., I am writing to formally continue my dispute the delinquency reported on my student loan account dated XX/XX/year&gt;, and to raise serious concerns regarding mishandling of my Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) applications currently in process. \\n\\nSummary of Issue : I submitted IDR and PSLF applications on XX/XX/year&gt;, via StudentAid.gov. \\n\\nAs of today, my XXXX XXXX confirms PSLF approval, showing XXXX out of XXXX qualifying payments. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I spoke with EdFinancial rep XXXX, who confirmed my loans are on temporary hold until XX/XX/year&gt;, due to the IDR application.

This transfer was due to an alleged default on my loan that occurred over 24 months ago. However, I would like to clarify several key issues regarding this situation that I believe constitute violations of my borrower rights. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Lack of Communication : I have never received any prior correspondence from HeartlandXXXX XXXXr was I informed of any default status on my loan. I was unaware that Heartland/XXXX XXXXas the servicer of my loan, and I received no notices about any late payments or issues with my loan. This lack of communication is particularly concerning given that I was unaware of any default status until the recent transfer notice. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Inaccurate Reporting and Default Status : My loans have been in forbearance, and they were in forbearance at the time of the alleged default. I have made diligent efforts to maintain the terms of my loan and was under the impression that my loans were properly serviced and managed during this forbearance period. The negative/adverse credit reporting associated with this situation is misleading, and I strongly contest the accuracy of the reported default. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Failure to Resolve the Issue with HeartlandXXXX : I made several attempts to resolve this issue directly with Heartland/XXXX  However, despite my efforts, the servicer failed to provide meaningful assistance or clarification regarding the status of my loan. This lack of support and communication has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. \\n\\nXXXX. ) Violation of Borrower Rights : I believe that my rights as a borrower have been violated due to the failure of HeartlandXXXX to communicate with me adequately regarding my loan, the apparent mishandling of the forbearance status, and the adverse reporting of my credit. \\n\\nGiven these issues, I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter and assist in rectifying the negative impact caused by the incorrect default status and the lack of communication from HeartlandXXXX. I seek the removal of any incorrect default information from my credit report and the proper resolution of my loan status in line with the protections provided to borrowers under federal law., I am submitting this complaint regarding the credit reporting practices of Nelnet, my previous federal student loan servicer. My loans have since been transferred to a new servicer, XXXX and the accounts are currently in Administrative Forbearance, with no payments due until XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts paid up and in good standing. \\n\\nDuring my time with Nelnet, I did fall behind on payments in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I believe the resulting credit damage is severely disproportionate, and the transition was poorly communicated, creating confusion about my loan status and available options. \\n\\nFirst, Nelnet has a documented history of consumer complaints related to poor communication, lack of transparency during delinquency, and unclear servicing practices, especially during periods of account transition. In my case, I was not informed clearly or promptly that my loans were being transferred, nor was I provided consistent information about whether payments were still due or whether forbearance or deferment options were available. \\n\\nAfter the transfer to XXXX, the accounts were placed into Administrative Forbearance, and no payments are currently required. Despite this, my credit reports still reflect dozens of 90-day late payment entries reported by Nelnet, one for each individual loan, even though the loans are no longer delinquent and have not entered default. \\n\\nI believe this reporting violates the principles of fair and accurate credit reporting, and does not reflect the current status of the account. While the technical reporting may be accurate from Nelnets perspective, the outcome for me as a borrower is deeply harmful and inconsistent with the spirit of federal student loan policy, especially when my accounts are now current and in government-sanctioned forbearance. \\n\\nI have attached a screenshot from my loan servicer portal showing the Administrative Forbearance status and the fact that no payment is due. \\n\\nThank you for your time and assistance., In XXXX my student loans from XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXXXXXX XXXX were consolidated into two loans.

This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. \\n\\nViolations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle. They are waiting over a week, despite being current as of today. \\n\\nUnder the Higher Education Act ( HEA ), borrowers in the process of applying for an income-driven plan should not be penalized with negative credit marks or be given misleading servicing advice that jeopardizes PSLF eligibility., In XX/XX/year&gt;, I received a notice from my loan servicer stating that my account was past due and would soon be in default. However, the account contains multiple legal discrepancies and privacy violations that I formally disputed on XX/XX/year&gt;, by sending certified letters to the loan servicer and the U.S. Department of Education. \\n\\nSpecifically, I believe my personal information was disclosed without my consent to unauthorized parties, which violates federal privacy law under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ). I also believe the loan was mishandled, with incomplete and inaccurate information provided to me, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), as well as the Higher Education Act. \\n\\nDespite contacting the company and requesting an investigation, verification of the loan, and resolution, the servicer continues to pursue collection without addressing my formal dispute., XXXXo weeks ago I noticed my credit score dropped XXXX points regarding 90 day late payment on student loans. I including XXXX others I know personally had the same thing happen. My student loans servicer was initially Great Lakes then without informing me loans were transferred to another company. I was not notified when exactly the loans were resumed nor notified that servicer was changed. I had auto payments set up initially under the impression my loans were still being paid on. How can I go about this? This is a lack of government transparency and now millions of Americans are being negatively impacted by it. XXXX unable to make any type of purchase bc of this and currently homeless bc I can not get approved for an apartment due to my credit., Report student loan servicer misconduct, including errors in loan balances, misapplied payments, and wrongful denials of repayment plans., I am filing this formal complaint against Aidvantage ( previously Navient ) for failing to execute a lawful loan discharge under the Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) Adjustment provision, in clear violation of : 20 U.S.C. 1087e ( d ) requiring loan discharge after 240 qualifying payments, and 34 CFR 685.206 obligating servicers to provide accurate information and not obstruct borrower rights.\\n\\nI have made 609 cumulative qualifying payments across 8 federal student loans dating back to XXXX, as detailed below. These include periods of repayment, forbearance, and defermentmuch of which qualifies under the IDR Account Adjustment rules issued by the Department of Education. \\n\\nPayment Breakdown ( based on my account records ) : XXXX Stafford Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Stafford Unsubsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Stafford Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Stafford Unsubsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Unsubsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Subsidized : XXXX payments XXXX Direct Loan Unsubsidized : XXXX payments Total : XXXX payments In XXXX, I contacted XXXX/Aidvantage  and explicitly requested my IDR adjustment months count. The representative verbally confirmed that my total payments exceed the XXXX requirement under IDR forgiveness, and that my loans were eligible for full discharge by XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, they also informed me that my discharge has been delayed due to technical limitations and staffing issues, not because of ineligibility. As of today, I am still waiting for this discharge to be honored, despite statutory eligibility.\\n\\nThe Higher Education Act mandates loan forgiveness after 240 payments under IDR plans ( 20 U.S.C. 1087e ( d ) ).\\n\\nFederal regulation ( 34 CFR 685.206 ) requires servicers to uphold borrower rights and not impede lawful discharge. \\n\\nI am now suffering financially and psychologically from an unjust delay that contradicts both the spirit and the letter of the law. Being currently unemployed, and interest continually accruing, it is unlikely that I can ever catch up on paying these loans., XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Unit XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX United States XXXX XXXX XX/XX/year&gt; Subject : Illegal Student Loan Reporting &amp; Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment Complaint Against : - DEPTEDNELNET ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX | ( XXXX ) XXXX ) - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX To Whom It May Concern, I am filing a formal complaint against DEPTEDNELNET, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.\\n\\nComplaint Details : 1.

Specifically, I am disputing the reported 90-day late payment status.\\n\\nAt the time the 90-day late notice appeared on my credit report, my loan ( s ) were in forbearance. I did not receive any notification that the forbearance was being lifted or that payments were becoming due. Due to unforeseen and significant personal circumstances, including being in and out of the XXXX  for the XXXX  of my XXXX  and undergoing XXXX XXXX, I was unaware of any change in my loan status. \\n\\nAs a result of this inaccurate reporting of a 90-day late payment, my credit score unfortunately dropped by approximately 150 points. \\n\\nI want to emphasize that the loan is currently completely paid off for Nelnet. While the account is settled, the negative impact of the erroneous 90-day late notice is severely affecting my ability to secure necessary credit. Most urgently, we were in the final stages of closing on a home, and at the last minute, the lender pulled my credit report and we were subsequently denied the loan due to this significant negative mark. The removal of this inaccurate 90-day late notice is the critical factor in improving my credit score and regaining our eligibility for the home. Currently we are scheduled to close on XX/XX/year&gt;. \\n\\nI request that you immediately investigate this matter and remove the inaccurate 90-day late payment notation from my credit report.\\n\\nPlease notify me of the results of your investigation and the removal of this inaccurate information as soon as possible.\\n\\nThank you for your prompt attention to this critical issue., I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect over XXXX late payment entries from XXXX, which has caused my XXXX XXXX to drop by over XXXX points. This action was taken without any prior notice, warning, or correspondenceI did not receive any emails, letters, or alerts informing me of this drastic change before it was reported to the credit bureaus. \\n\\nAdditionally, I have become aware of an ongoing data breach involving student loan accounts, which raises serious concerns regarding unauthorized access to my personal and financial information raising concerns over a XXXX violation. Given this security lapse, I have reason to believe that my account records may have been compromised or altered without my consent. \\n\\nI am in the process of purchasing a home and this has caused my loan to be halted until this is remedied. This has caused extreme financial distress and this error in reporting needs to be remedied immediately. I did not authorize any changes to my account status, and I no longer feel comfortable having my student loans serviced and reported to the credit bureaus under these conditions. \\n\\nViolations and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Failure to Provide Notice of Negative Credit Reporting - Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), loan servicers are required to provide accurate and fair reporting. I was not notified in advance that these accounts would be marked late, which denied me the opportunity to address any potential issues before they were reported. \\n\\nXXXX.

If my data was exposed or manipulated, Nelnet may have incorrectly or fraudulently reported late payments that I did not actually incur. \\n\\nXXXX. Failure to Properly Investigate and Verify Account Status - Given the security risks and errors in reporting, I request full verification and documentation proving the legitimacy of the late payments, including a detailed account history showing how and when they were marked late., Thank you for reviewing my concerns. I respectfully disagree with the assertion that nothing was reported late on Aidvantages end, as it disregards the core issue : incorrect and inconsistent reporting of my repayment start date. \\n\\nMy final coursework in the University XXXX  Georgia XXXX XXXX program concluded in summer XXXX, and my degree was conferred on XX/XX/XXXX. Despite this, Aidvantage incorrectly relied on a XX/XX/XXXX graduation date, as reported in an earlier data transfer, and initiated repayment with a due date of XXXX XXXXwithout verifying the updated NSLDS information. This misalignment led to the wrongful early start of my repayment period. \\n\\nI proactively worked with the University of Georgia to correct the record. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Senior Assistant Registrar, confirmed that UGA  manually updated the graduation date in the NSLDS Clearinghouse to reflect my summer XXXX graduation term. This means Aidvantage has access to the correct data and still failed to adjust my grace period or repayment terms accordingly. \\n\\nAidvantages statement that \" there is no negative reporting '' is misleading. While they may not have marked payments as formally delinquent, the incorrect repayment start date has affected the accounts age, status, and monthly payment history, which are critical components of credit scoring models used by mortgage underwriters, financial institutions, etc. The impact is not limited to delinquencyaccuracy matters. \\n\\nDespite calls and emails, including my direct outreach to my assigned representative, XXXX, I have not received confirmation that : Aidvantage received and processed the corrected NSLDS data ; My grace period has been properly reinstated ; My repayment start date has been realigned with the correct graduation date ; My credit file has been updated to reflect these changes. \\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), furnishers of credit information have a legal obligation to report accurate and complete information. Whether a late payment is marked or not, the inaccurate reporting of account status, timing, or terms still constitutes a violation of that obligation., I was enrolled in automatic payments for my federal student loan prior to the COVID-19 forbearance period. During the pause, auto-debit was suspended. When payments resumed, I was not notified by my servicer that auto-pay would not restart automatically. As a result, I unintentionally missed three payments and was marked 90 days delinquent on my credit report. \\n\\nI brought the account current as soon as I discovered the error. Ive contacted the loan servicer, but they have refused to remove the late payment. I believe this negative mark is the result of a failure in communication and servicer procedures, not intentional nonpayment on my part. I am requesting the CFPB 's assistance in reviewing this matter and encouraging the servicer to make a one-time goodwill adjustment., I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing. My credit report was recently updated to reflect over XXXX late payment entries from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which has caused my XXXX XXXX to drop by over XXXX points.

I want to share my experience regarding an error on my credit report related to my student loan account Loan Servicer : Aidvantage Account # XXXX. My report shows a 90-day late payment, which I believe is incorrect. \\n\\nA 90-day late payment indicates that Ive missed three payments in a row, which can significantly impact my credit score. In reality, my payment history is current, and I have only missed one payment, which should be reported as a 30-day late payment instead. The difference between these two statuses is substantial, and I want to ensure that my credit report accurately reflects my payment behavior. \\n\\nI also want to highlight that according to the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) Section 9-507, creditors are required to report accurate information about a consumers payment history. Misreporting can lead to misunderstandings about my financial responsibility and affect my ability to secure loans in the future.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my concerns. I appreciate any guidance or assistance you can provide regarding this matter., Good Morning, In XXXX of XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) to apply for a Direct Plus loan. I was told to wait until XXXX of XXXX. When I applied the loXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXRONG date and used school year XX/XX/XXXX instead of XX/XX/XXXX - ( THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Financial Aid in XXXX XXXX after hours and hours on my end trying to figure out what happened! ) As a result and since I did not see the Direct Plus loan on my daughter 's financial aid report I borrowed {$11000.00} AGAIN in XXXX of XXXX. I then began to get emails from Nelnet about the {$22000.00} that I had borrowed. I immediately contacted them to inquire as to the amount and then is when I had to make a many, many phones calls to XXXX and Nelnet to track down the issue. Again, the ERROR was found to be with XXXX and was fully admitted on their part. I was informed that they were returning their mistake ( Loan # 1 ) and that there was no further action needed on my part. As it turned out, my daughter earned additional scholarships and worked thorughout the summer and fall and we did NOT use ANY of the Loan # 2 and I returned all of it in XX/XX/XXXX and have a letter from Nelnet stating that the loan was repaid in full and without penalty because it was within 6 months. \\nLast week, XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from Nelnet stating that I owe {$320.00} in principal and interest from Loan # XXXX - XXXX XXXX 's error! I then spent countless hours calling XXXX, XXXX and even the Department of Education to resolve this matter. I was told from Nelnet and Dept of Ed that neither one had control of the loan and to contact the other entity. XXXX ignored my request to discuss the matter and instead sent me this link to file a complain. \\nIn a nut shell, I am being asked to pay {$320.00} for money that was NEVER USED! Yes, the request ( XXXX ) was processed, the first time erroneously and WITHOUT my ever knowing it and the second time I returned it within 2 months! I did my due diligence, I spent hours tracking down their mistake, was told that it was taken care of and yet, I am stuck with a {$320.00} bill for money that NEVER even applied/used/withdrawn etc. \\nPlease help me resolve this! I thought I had taken care of everything and yet, it continues. XXXX has not offered any help even though they are solely responsible and Nelnet keeps telling me they don't have anything to do with the loan which I can not understand their position since they issued the loan! \\nPlease, I am not trying to get away with anything, my wife and I have helped our children ( ironically three of them went to XXXX ) and they have worked their tails off academically and over the summers so that we would never have to borrow money. This was the first and will be the only time that we borrow and it has proven to be nothing but a headache and I feel as though it is not our fault nor should we be asked to repay anything since no money was used. \\nThank you very much for your time and effort on our behalf!, To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Subject : Formal Complaint Against MOHELA for Improper Collection and Credit Reporting During Federal Pause Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a formal complaint against MOHELA regarding their handling of my federal student loan account, including attempts to collect payment during the federally mandated payment pause, improper credit reporting, and failure to provide notice of a loan servicer transfer. \\n\\nDespite the federal student loan forbearance in place at the timewhich clearly paused payments, interest, and collection activitiesMOHELA attempted to collect payment from me. This action was in direct conflict with the terms of the federal pause. Furthermore, my loan account has since been negatively reported to credit bureaus based on these improper collection attempts, causing harm to my credit standing. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, my loan was transferred from a previous servicer to MOHELA without my knowledge or consent, and I did not receive any official notification of the transfer. As a result, I was left unaware of any changes in account status or payment expectations, further complicating the situation and increasing the potential for errors and misunderstandings. \\n\\nThese actions by MOHELA appear to violate consumer protections and the terms of the federal student loan relief measures. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter, ensure any inaccurate credit reporting is corrected, and hold MOHELA accountable for any non-compliant or deceptive practices. \\n\\nPlease let me know what additional documentation or information you may require from me to move forward with this complaint. \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX il XXXX XXXX XXXX, Inaccurate late payments are reporting on my credit report from student loans., I am filing this complaint against XXXX due to severe and unjustified negative credit reporting that has significantly impacted my financial standing.

Nature of Complaint : Inaccurate reporting to credit bureaus Unlawful collection practices I am filing this complaint against Nelnet due to errors in my student loan account. On XX/XX/scrub&gt;XXXX I noticed that my loan balance was incorrectly reported as {$58000.00}, despite my payments being up to date. my request for an Income-Driven Repayment Plan was wrongfully denied, despite meeting eligibility requirements. Also it has been unauthorized access to my account which is a direct violation of my privacy., I am writing to file a formal complaint regarding the inaccurate and harmful credit reporting associated with my federal student loan account, previously serviced by Nelnet and recently transferred to XXXX. This situation has caused significant and immediate damage to my credit profile, and I believe it reflects a broader systemic issue affecting many borrowers during the transition out of pandemic-related deferment. \\n\\nHere is a detailed account of my experience : My student loans originated 12 years ago and have been in deferment for the past XXXX years. \\nI have a track record of making on-time payments during periods when the loans were in active repayment. \\nWithout clear or sufficient warning, my loans exited deferment, and XXXX missed payments were reported all at once indicating a XXXX delinquency despite receiving no XXXX or XXXX notices. \\nI was only made aware of the delinquency after it was reported to the credit bureaus, at which point I acted immediately. \\nI made a payment of {$500.00} on XX/XX/2025, bringing my account current. My total balance across all XXXX loan accounts is {$3500.00}. \\nThe very next day, on XX/XX/2025, my account was transferred from Nelnet to XXXX and placed into forbearance, without explanation, adding to the confusion and instability of servicing. \\n\\nI want to clearly state that I acknowledge there is some fault on my part. It is the borrowers responsibility to remain informed and current. However, after such a long period of deferment, the sudden reactivation of the loans without any formal XXXX notice was not an effective or fair practice. Instead of official communication, the only warnings I received were unfamiliar phone calls which I, like many others in this era of widespread scam activity, ignored for security reasons. In todays climate, unrecognized calls are not a reasonable substitute for formal written or electronic notices. \\n\\nSince the incident occurred, I have taken responsible steps to address it : I wrote to both Nelnet and XXXX requesting a goodwill credit adjustment. \\nI filed a complaint with my XXXX Attorney XXXX office. \\nI have disputed the late payments with the major credit bureaus. \\n\\nThis situation is part of a nationwide pattern, where borrowers who acted in good faith during deferment are now facing disproportionate financial harm due to inadequate communication, mismanagement, and sudden servicing transitions. I am fully capable and committed to maintaining on-time payments, and I am asking that this issue be reviewed with consideration for a credit reporting correction or relief, based on the circumstances and my prompt action. \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I am happy to provide any documentation or communication history needed. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX, Aidvantage did not do its due diligence to make sure they had my accurate info before reaching out about the status of my loans going into repayment.

Additionally, they mark my credit report with the loans as current status until XXXX, then hit my report with a XXXX delinquency in XXXX. This is obviously not 90 days.

Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. 2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. 3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). I demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action., I am devastated. I would like to report a situation with my student loans. I recently found out my loans were in default. I have never been in default with my student loans. They notified me on my email instead to mail that I was delinquent. Needless to say I had nine accounts that went 90 days past due and dropped my score over XXXX points. I have Aid Avantage and I did not know who the servicer was until I reviewed my credit report. I would like for them to remove the past due notice off of all 9 accounts. I was denied a student loan for my daughter and we dont know what we are going to do because of it. Also there have been 2 credit card closures from my credit because of this., This is a formal legal demand for immediate investigation and permanent deletion of all student loan accounts reported under the tradeline \" DEPT OF XXXX, '' which is NELNET, XXXX my credit report. These accounts include all loanssubsidized, unsubsidized, and Parent PLUSand their continued presence on my report constitutes an egregious violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection law. It has come to light through extensive reporting and insider disclosures that entities affiliated with or under the operational influence of XXXX XXXX, specifically DOGE-related ventures, gained illegal and unrestricted access to sensitive borrower data stored within Department of Education systems. This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. The unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. Furthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S., Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. You have been formally notified., There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. I am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., I am writing to formally dispute my XXXX XXXX XXXX and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without my authorization, which violates multiple federal laws designed to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the immediate cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt in full, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request ; Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, violating FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections. Breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information was improperly accessed and shared without my authorization'ating my privacy riahts under federai law. Violation of the Higher Education Act ; As a student loan borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections. Breach of Contract and Negligence ; The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, putting my financial security at risk., I am writing to formally dispute inaccurate information on my credit report. This dispute is submitted under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 16811, which requires credit reporting agencies to conduct a reasonable reinvestigation of disputed items. Recent findings by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) have brought to light significant concerns regarding XXXX  and XXXX XXXX failure to conduct proper investigations. Specifically, in a lawsuit filed against XXXX  and XXXX, the CFPB alleges that the company engaged in sham investigations, violating consumer protection laws by failing to meet its obligations under the FCRA. As per 15 U.S.C., According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year&gt;, but nothing else. If i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue., Our own direction of Human Resources has noted other teachers with the same issue. It appears as though that EdFinancial is deliberately trying to stall in order for borrowers to give up.]</td>\n",

I have federal student loans through Edfinancial Services. I have made multiple payments multiple times to pay for my loans. Only one payment has been accepted by Edfinancial Services. I can include a full payment history if necessary. The first instance of this was on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid the total balance ( principal + interest ) on this date of {$200.00} and the payment was reversed the same day. The next instance of me trying to make a payment was XX/XX/XXXX. I paid {$420.00} and the payment was again reversed the same day without my knowledge. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$420.00}. This was the only payment that has ever gone through to them, which doesn't make any sense. On this day, and several times I have set up auto payments and they have not gone through. Even recently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I made a huge payment of {$1500.00}, and again, it was reversed the same day without my knowledge or notification. They even gave me a CONFIRMATION email stating that my payment was received. However, they never informed me that this was reversed. This has hugely affected my credit score as it has dropped my credit from XXXX to XXXX which is a drop of XXXX points. I have seen that Edfinancial has faced several legal cases online. This behavior is frankly predatory., FAFSA did not inform me that EdFinancial had been designated as my loan servicer. Additionally, EdFinancial failed to notify me by mail or any other means that they had assumed responsibility for servicing my loans. Unlike my previous loan servicers, XXXX XXXX and XXXX who promptly sent formal written notices upon assignment, EdFinancial provided no such communication.\\n\\nAs a result, I was unaware of their involvement until they reported XXXX missed payments directly to the credit bureauwithout giving me prior notice or an opportunity to address the issue. This lack of communication and transparency is a serious departure from standard industry practices and has caused significant harm to my credit standing., I am writing to formally continue my dispute the delinquency reported on my student loan account dated XX/XX/year&gt;, and to raise serious concerns regarding mishandling of my Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) applications currently in process. \\n\\nSummary of Issue : I submitted IDR and PSLF applications on XX/XX/year&gt;, via StudentAid.gov. \\n\\nAs of today, my XXXX XXXX confirms PSLF approval, showing XXXX out of XXXX qualifying payments. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I spoke with EdFinancial rep XXXX, who confirmed my loans are on temporary hold until XX/XX/year&gt;, due to the IDR application. They were very reluctant to help, refusing to transfer my call to his supervisor and refused to give me his name. When requested he stated no for both, lacking transparency. It wasn't until he could no longer provide relevant information I requested that he granted my transfer to his supervisor. \\n\\nHe informed me the delinquency would be reversed and my account would be reported as current by XX/XX/year&gt; due to my pending IDR application A supervisor, XXXX, confirmed retroactive payment adjustments and provided a timeline of prior contact attempts many of which I never received. \\n\\nI have already filed disputes with XXXX XXXX XXXX and submitted My first complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). \\n\\nThis now the issue I am having with EdFinicial : PSLF Concerns : During the call, XXXX pushed me to consolidate my loans, despite the fact that doing so would cause me to lose all XXXX qualifying PSLF payments already recorded. He also insisted that they, EdFinicial, would still be my loan servicers. This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. \\n\\nViolations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle. They are waiting over a week, despite being current as of today. \\n\\nUnder the Higher Education Act ( HEA ), borrowers in the process of applying for an income-driven plan should not be penalized with negative credit marks or be given misleading servicing advice that jeopardizes PSLF eligibility., I am writing to formally address a discrepancy Ive noticed regarding my student loan account after it was transferred from XXXX to EdFinancial. My loans have been in a no-interest forbearance period since the onset of the XXXX relief measures in XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, I recently observed an increase of {$640.00} in my principal balance, which appears to be a result of interest capitalization. Prior to the transfer, my loan balance was {$49000.00}, and there should have been no interest accrual or capitalization during the federally mandated forbearance period. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I contacted EdFinancial to request a correction to this error. I also filed a formal complaint with XXXX regarding the matter. Unfortunately, I have not received a response or seen any corrective action taken to date. \\n\\nThis adjustment appears to be a clear error, as the forbearance provisions under the XXXX XXXX and subsequent extensions specified that no interest would accrue during the relief period. Therefore, no capitalization should have occurred upon transfer or resumption of payments. \\n\\nAdditionally, Ive encountered repeated errors when attempting to make payments through EdFinancials online portal. Specifically, the system has failed multiple times to process my auto-debit payment, without any clear communication or notification that payments were not going through. This has created confusion and concern regarding the status of my repayment efforts., Ed financial reported my student loan account as 90 day delinquent. This has caused my family and I to jeopardize our home loan that was set to close in the next 30 days. Due to EdFinancial not confirming or actively making sure they had the correct contact information to relay the information to myself that student loan payments had started again, this dropped my credit score a staggering XXXX points ruining my credit and any chances of providing for my family. As of today I have filed disputes with the 3 credit bureaus as well as EdFinancial., I contacted Edfinancial about my federal student loan and {$12000.00} capitalized interest added to my overall balance due to XXXX ( previous ) loan servicer transferring my student loan over to Edfinancial via forbearance. Also I have received conflicting information about the number of payments made to public service loan forgiveness from both edfinancial and studentaid.gov. I graduated from school in 2017 and have been making on time payments in full since and now my balance is increasing due to mismanagement and inaccurate accounting on part of loan services. Also my credit score has went down because of this poor mismanagement, I have XXXX loans through Edfinancial from when I attended a university for a single semester. Years later, I started getting hit with late payments on loan repayment with little to no notice. Now, my credit score has significantly dropped just before I was getting ready to get pre approved for a home, now that plan has completely derailed. I had to do extensive investigating and research just to find out I was responsible for this this loan. I have a private student loan that I have been making payments on for last couple years no issues. I thought that was my loan I owed and that was it. Edfinancial has provided me little to no notice about payments I would be responsible for this loan I didnt even realize I had. Then suddenly, my credit score tanked. When I call to inquire about this loan and issue, its next to impossible to talk to a real representative about it and nobody to assist me and answer questions I have. They are ruining my financial planning and next steps in my life Im trying to take. After loopholes I figured out ON MY OWN, I finally now have gotten access to view these loans to find out I have multiple late payments Edfinancial didnt make much an effort to reach out and notify me about., In either XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, the Federal government paused student loan repayments. Since that time, I have received no communication from EdFinancial regarding my loans or repayment status. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a series of letters in the mail ; one provided a statement, another a notification of a failed auto-payment and a third stating that my account was over 120 days late. I had no clue what these letters were and was shocked. I went to the link that the letters directed, and realized this was for EdFinancial and it wasn't a scam, seeking payment. When I logged into the account, I saw through the payment history, that they'd been attempting auto-debits since XX/XX/XXXX to an account that I had closed in XXXX. No notification had ever been sent to me to state that loans were going back into repayment. That aside, no notification has ever been sent to me to indicate that they'd been unsuccessfully attempting payment for the last 18 months. Only on XX/XX/XXXX had I received notice. I paid the late payment through my new checking account with another institution. When I spoke with an agent, she informed me that I was on electronic notification delivery. That said, not once had EdFinancial e-mailed me to say that they were attempting payment and payment had failed, or that they were even going into repayment status. Those messages sat in the EdFinancial inbox and no e-mail had ever been sent to my e-mail, which was on file with them, to indicate messages were waiting for me to read. Further, they had not sent me any letters in the mail either. They have now reported me 120 days late, even though I'm current and made myself current as soon as they actually notified me. This is incredibly deceptive and I made the late payment but if I'd been sent letter previously, as they finally did on XX/XX/XXXX, I would have addressed this before it ever went into a late status. They collected interest on me for loans that I could have already have paid off by now, if they'd only been responsible enough to reach out to me. I have received no e-mail or written letter from them in nearly 5 years and now they report me late without allowing me the opportunity to pay.]</td>\n",

This has created confusion and concern regarding the status of my repayment efforts., To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Subject : Formal Complaint Against MOHELA for Improper Collection and Credit Reporting During Federal Pause Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a formal complaint against MOHELA regarding their handling of my federal student loan account, including attempts to collect payment during the federally mandated payment pause, improper credit reporting, and failure to provide notice of a loan servicer transfer. \\n\\nDespite the federal student loan forbearance in place at the timewhich clearly paused payments, interest, and collection activitiesMOHELA attempted to collect payment from me. This action was in direct conflict with the terms of the federal pause. Furthermore, my loan account has since been negatively reported to credit bureaus based on these improper collection attempts, causing harm to my credit standing. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, my loan was transferred from a previous servicer to MOHELA without my knowledge or consent, and I did not receive any official notification of the transfer. As a result, I was left unaware of any changes in account status or payment expectations, further complicating the situation and increasing the potential for errors and misunderstandings. \\n\\nThese actions by MOHELA appear to violate consumer protections and the terms of the federal student loan relief measures. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter, ensure any inaccurate credit reporting is corrected, and hold MOHELA accountable for any non-compliant or deceptive practices. \\n\\nPlease let me know what additional documentation or information you may require from me to move forward with this complaint. \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX il XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was notified by a 3rd party that there was a change to my credit score. It dropped XXXX points! I log in to find out why, shows it's a student loan reporting delinquent. \\nI set-up an account for this new loan servicer NelNet, and it shows as IN FORBEARANCE ( I have screenshots to verify!! ). How can you show that it's in FORBEARANCE and then suddenly with no notice show it as delinquent and drop someone's credit score by XXXX points with no notice?!! \\nA search on XXXX about this led me to find this has been suddenly happening to TONS of people with the same loan servicer!!!! \\n\\nI was not notified that this was about to happen and given time to make any needed arrangements!, Im reaching out because I urgently need legal help regarding what I believe to be a predatory and deceptive student loan consolidation that has dramatically inflated my original student loan debtwithout my full understanding, knowledge, or consent. \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I attended college and borrowed a total of approximately {$6600.00} in student loans XXXX XXXX and XXXX ). These loans were later consolidated in XXXX I understood to be paid in full through that process. \\n\\nHowever, in XX/XX/XXXX, a new XXXX XXXX XXXX was created for {$23000.00}, without any formal or transparent communication with me. This debt includes significant interest and penalties I was not informed about over the years, despite believing my loans were handled through the prior consolidation. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, my loan records reflect conflicting statuses : Paid in Full through Consolidation appears multiple times for the same loans. \\n\\nA loan dated XXXX lists a disbursement of {$23000.00}, even though I have not attended school or requested a loan since the XXXX. \\n\\nI never knowingly agreed to this new consolidation, and if I did sign anything, it was under misleading or unclear circumstancespossibly connected to past bankruptcies, forbearance confusion, or default status chaos. \\n\\nThis feels like systematic deception and financial abuse, and I believe I am being taken advantage of through a system that thrives on complexity and a lack of clear borrower communication. \\n\\nI need legal help to : Challenge the legitimacy of the XXXX consolidation loan Determine whether my original loans were actually paid or resolved Assess if this situation qualifies for student loan discharge or debt relief Hold the Department of Education or loan servicers accountable for misleading or unauthorized actions I am overwhelmed, out of resources, and truly in need of an advocate who can help me fight for the truth and my rights.\\n\\nPlease let me know if this is something your office can assist with, or if you can refer me to someone who specializes in cases like mine. Thank you deeply for your time, your help, and your compassion., I went to pay my student loans on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$150.00} via the link provided in my emails from EdFinancial. Every time I pay, I get a confirmation email, but then my payment is reversed on the student loan site without informing me.

I tried to make a payment today XX/XX/XXXX for now a much larger amount of {$210.00} and called my bank to verify, they said that they see no pending request. I call EdFinancial yet another time and they said that there's nothing they can do further. My banking info has been reset multiple times and I've also tried to pay over the phone with a representative. I'm on an IDR plan because I can't afford much, and now interest is accruing on loans I've been trying to pay. Any help is appreciated, because I don't know what else to do., My XXXX XXXX XXXX  servicer was XXXX and I had no issues and made my payments on time. Now my loans have been moved to a new servicer called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I'm trying to make my account so I can make my payments on time as I always have and it's saying they don't have my info. I did some research on the topic and this is happening to many people across the XXXX so that you have late payments and fees and ruin your credit and have to pay even more. It's criminal and wrong., Thank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \\n\\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \\n\\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \\n\\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \\n\\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \\n\\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \\n\\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \\n\\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \\n\\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \\n\\nThank you for your time and effort., Hi, I was enrolled in the SAVE plan in 2023 for my student loans through EdFinancial Services, and because of my current income, my payments were {$0.00} per month. I was told that since my payments were {$0.00}, that I did not have to make a payment and that interest was technically accumulating, but it was being covered by the government. I now checked on my loan website again, and now it says that I owe an additional ~ $ XXXX. I called and they said that if I had made a payment of even {$1.00} per month, that the interest would have been covered, but since it was XXXX, that it was not covered. I would like to dispute this, as my student loan provider lied to me and gave me false information. Had this information been offered from the beginning, I would have tried to pay something each month. Now I owe an extra $ XXXX. I also tried to call and file a complaint and to see if I could retroactively pay or resolve this peacefully ; however, I was not allowed to speak to someone regarding the complaint, and I was unable to get a phone number or other contact information. \\n\\nThe person who I just spoke to today was helpful and his employee number is XXXX. I'm pretty sure when I called in XX/XX/year&gt; and was given this false information, they refused to give me their employee IDs, The company NelNet did not have the correct contact information in regards to my federal student loans. They never mailed me a letter saying that the forbearance on the account has ended. Never mailed me a letter saying that payments on my account have started. Never mailed me to inform me that my account was delinquent. I only found out after checking my credit score and noticing a XXXX XXXX from 8 missed payments on 4 different loans XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not know my student loan payments were set to resume and they had the wrong contact information like email and phone number, but they did have the correct address. My account was than transferred to XXXX. I called NelNet to try to get the \" late payments '' removed from my account but said they could not do so. How am I suppose to make a payment to a company that I didn't even have an account set up for if they never reached out and contacted me about it?]</td>\n",

I paid the total balance ( principal + interest ) on this date of {$200.00} and the payment was reversed the same day. The next instance of me trying to make a payment was XX/XX/XXXX. I paid {$420.00} and the payment was again reversed the same day without my knowledge. On XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment of {$420.00}. This was the only payment that has ever gone through to them, which doesn't make any sense. On this day, and several times I have set up auto payments and they have not gone through. Even recently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I made a huge payment of {$1500.00}, and again, it was reversed the same day without my knowledge or notification. They even gave me a CONFIRMATION email stating that my payment was received. However, they never informed me that this was reversed. This has hugely affected my credit score as it has dropped my credit from XXXX to XXXX which is a drop of XXXX points. I have seen that Edfinancial has faced several legal cases online. This behavior is frankly predatory., I am writing to formally continue my dispute the delinquency reported on my student loan account dated XX/XX/year&gt;, and to raise serious concerns regarding mishandling of my Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) applications currently in process. \\n\\nSummary of Issue : I submitted IDR and PSLF applications on XX/XX/year&gt;, via StudentAid.gov. \\n\\nAs of today, my XXXX XXXX confirms PSLF approval, showing XXXX out of XXXX qualifying payments. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I spoke with EdFinancial rep XXXX, who confirmed my loans are on temporary hold until XX/XX/year&gt;, due to the IDR application. They were very reluctant to help, refusing to transfer my call to his supervisor and refused to give me his name. When requested he stated no for both, lacking transparency. It wasn't until he could no longer provide relevant information I requested that he granted my transfer to his supervisor. \\n\\nHe informed me the delinquency would be reversed and my account would be reported as current by XX/XX/year&gt; due to my pending IDR application A supervisor, XXXX, confirmed retroactive payment adjustments and provided a timeline of prior contact attempts many of which I never received. \\n\\nI have already filed disputes with XXXX XXXX XXXX and submitted My first complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). \\n\\nThis now the issue I am having with EdFinicial : PSLF Concerns : During the call, XXXX pushed me to consolidate my loans, despite the fact that doing so would cause me to lose all XXXX qualifying PSLF payments already recorded. He also insisted that they, EdFinicial, would still be my loan servicers. This was deeply concerning, especially since XXXX is the designated servicer for PSLF, and my loans have not yet been transferred from EdFinancial. \\n\\nViolations and Legal Basis : Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), data furnishers like EdFinancial must report accurate and timely information. Reporting me delinquent while in active repayment plan review appears to violate this principle. They are waiting over a week, despite being current as of today. \\n\\nUnder the Higher Education Act ( HEA ), borrowers in the process of applying for an income-driven plan should not be penalized with negative credit marks or be given misleading servicing advice that jeopardizes PSLF eligibility., Student loan servicer misconduct, including errors in loan balances, misapplied payments, and wrongful denials of payment plans., I have federal student loans managed by Edfinancial Services. I have spoken with them by phone, but I still believe there are inaccuracies in my account, including the loan balance and how interest is being calculated. Despite my attempts to get clarification, my concerns have not been resolved. \\nIn addition, l 've been receiving repeated phone calls from Edfinancial. When I answer, there is silence no one speaks. I've even said things like \" please say something this time, '' and they hang up after a few seconds. This has happened multiple times. It's unsettling and feels like harassment. \\nThese calls and unresolved errors have been worsening my mental health XXXX, including XXXX  XXXX  and XXXX, for which I have XXXX  documentation. I had XXXX XXXX for test XXXX  in school and XXXX  from college XXXX  due to the impact of these conditions. This loan debt and the way it's being handled have significantly contributed to my stress. \\n\\n( Additionally XXXX XXXX DOGE team accessing my student information through accessing the department of education makes me very uneasy. this violates my FERPA and HIPAA. this is just a minor detail but id like this proven or disproven ) I am asking the CFPB to help ensure : - My account is reviewed thoroughly and corrected if there are errors. \\n- These silent or repeated calls stop. \\n- I am treated with transparency and respect moving forward. \\n- Look into every time theyve called the last couple years, and note how theyve not spoken. theyve recently reported 90 days past due without telling me i was behind and now my credit score has dropped XXXX points please remove them from my credit report and remove any negative notes on my credit, I am writing to formally address a discrepancy Ive noticed regarding my student loan account after it was transferred from XXXX to EdFinancial. My loans have been in a no-interest forbearance period since the onset of the XXXX relief measures in XXXX. \\n\\nHowever, I recently observed an increase of {$640.00} in my principal balance, which appears to be a result of interest capitalization. Prior to the transfer, my loan balance was {$49000.00}, and there should have been no interest accrual or capitalization during the federally mandated forbearance period. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I contacted EdFinancial to request a correction to this error. I also filed a formal complaint with XXXX regarding the matter. Unfortunately, I have not received a response or seen any corrective action taken to date. \\n\\nThis adjustment appears to be a clear error, as the forbearance provisions under the XXXX XXXX and subsequent extensions specified that no interest would accrue during the relief period. Therefore, no capitalization should have occurred upon transfer or resumption of payments. \\n\\nAdditionally, Ive encountered repeated errors when attempting to make payments through EdFinancials online portal. Specifically, the system has failed multiple times to process my auto-debit payment, without any clear communication or notification that payments were not going through. This has created confusion and concern regarding the status of my repayment efforts., My 2 student loans are through EdFinancial services. The amounts are not significant, however, Ive began to attempt to make payments since XX/XX/XXXX. Every single attempt at a payment Ive made since then only continues to be reversed back to me from the lender. Im unsure why they continuously reverse all my payments back to me, and its reached a point theyve made my credit score drop significantly. Ive tried to pay more than whats due in hopes for that to work, only for them to reverse my payment without any explanation or help. Im at a loss and I cant let my credit score drop. My most recent payment made on XX/XX/XXXX says its still processing but I know its a matter of time when they reverse my payment which hurts me further., Dear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding EdFinancial 's misrepresentation and mishandling of my student loan, which has resulted in financial hardship and damage to my credit. \\n\\nKey Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.\\n\\nRelying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. \\n\\nI was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.\\n\\nUnfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.\\n\\nHad I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.\\n\\nMishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. \\n\\nFor years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\\n\\nFinancial &amp; Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score., XX/XX/year&gt; Ed Financial Student Loan Servicing Company reported me as 90 days late for federal student loans. Up until this point, they consistently reported me as current. This dropped my score down from XXXX to ( XXXX ). \\n\\nThe issue : I never received a warning from the student loan service company that they're starting to require payment. \\n\\nXX/XX/year&gt; I called Ed Financial Student Loan Servicing Company. I asked for a way to change the reporting to 30 days late or something since I didn't receive a warning that they had started reporting, requiring payment, or anything. \\n\\nWhen I asked for support, they didn't listen, responded with their \" policy \", and talked down to me making me feel bad about my financial position., Ed financial reported my student loan account as 90 day delinquent. This has caused my family and I to jeopardize our home loan that was set to close in the next 30 days. Due to EdFinancial not confirming or actively making sure they had the correct contact information to relay the information to myself that student loan payments had started again, this dropped my credit score a staggering XXXX points ruining my credit and any chances of providing for my family. As of today I have filed disputes with the 3 credit bureaus as well as EdFinancial., I went to pay my student loans on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$150.00} via the link provided in my emails from EdFinancial. Every time I pay, I get a confirmation email, but then my payment is reversed on the student loan site without informing me. I spoke to several XXXX XXXX reps who said they have no record of EdFinancial ever requesting money. I tried to make a payment today XX/XX/XXXX for now a much larger amount of {$210.00} and called my bank to verify, they said that they see no pending request. I call EdFinancial yet another time and they said that there's nothing they can do further. My banking info has been reset multiple times and I've also tried to pay over the phone with a representative. I'm on an IDR plan because I can't afford much, and now interest is accruing on loans I've been trying to pay. Any help is appreciated, because I don't know what else to do., In either XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, the Federal government paused student loan repayments. Since that time, I have received no communication from EdFinancial regarding my loans or repayment status. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a series of letters in the mail ; one provided a statement, another a notification of a failed auto-payment and a third stating that my account was over 120 days late. I had no clue what these letters were and was shocked. I went to the link that the letters directed, and realized this was for EdFinancial and it wasn't a scam, seeking payment. When I logged into the account, I saw through the payment history, that they'd been attempting auto-debits since XX/XX/XXXX to an account that I had closed in XXXX. No notification had ever been sent to me to state that loans were going back into repayment. That aside, no notification has ever been sent to me to indicate that they'd been unsuccessfully attempting payment for the last 18 months. Only on XX/XX/XXXX had I received notice. I paid the late payment through my new checking account with another institution. When I spoke with an agent, she informed me that I was on electronic notification delivery. That said, not once had EdFinancial e-mailed me to say that they were attempting payment and payment had failed, or that they were even going into repayment status. Those messages sat in the EdFinancial inbox and no e-mail had ever been sent to my e-mail, which was on file with them, to indicate messages were waiting for me to read. Further, they had not sent me any letters in the mail either. They have now reported me 120 days late, even though I'm current and made myself current as soon as they actually notified me. This is incredibly deceptive and I made the late payment but if I'd been sent letter previously, as they finally did on XX/XX/XXXX, I would have addressed this before it ever went into a late status. They collected interest on me for loans that I could have already have paid off by now, if they'd only been responsible enough to reach out to me. I have received no e-mail or written letter from them in nearly 5 years and now they report me late without allowing me the opportunity to pay., Edfinancial has been contacting me at an outdated email and home address, due to this I was not made aware that my student loan repayment began and that it reached 90 day delinquency. Edfinancial 's response on page 7 of the document \" Servicers Response '' states \" Edfinancial uses a variety of commercial vendors to identify a borrower 's contact information. Vendors include the major consumer credit reporting agencies, with additional support provided by industry leaders such as XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and Electronic White Pages . Throughout the payment pause, Edfinancial placed a priority on maintaining accurate demographic information and borrower engagement. We continued skip tracing efforts when we identified that a borrower 's contact information may have become invalid. Outbound dialing jobs ran weekly to obtain updated mailing addresses. '' However, if they followed up on this statement Edificial would have been made aware through these reporting agencies that my contact information was indeed not current. Please review dispute letter provided as an attachment for further information. When reviewing my credit reports there is no indication of late payments for the months of XXXX and XXXX. My account is noted as current/conditions met. Moving to XXXX my reports reflects a 90 day delinquency or no reporting at all., I have XXXX loans through Edfinancial from when I attended a university for a single semester. Years later, I started getting hit with late payments on loan repayment with little to no notice. Now, my credit score has significantly dropped just before I was getting ready to get pre approved for a home, now that plan has completely derailed. I had to do extensive investigating and research just to find out I was responsible for this this loan. I have a private student loan that I have been making payments on for last couple years no issues. I thought that was my loan I owed and that was it. Edfinancial has provided me little to no notice about payments I would be responsible for this loan I didnt even realize I had. Then suddenly, my credit score tanked. When I call to inquire about this loan and issue, its next to impossible to talk to a real representative about it and nobody to assist me and answer questions I have. They are ruining my financial planning and next steps in my life Im trying to take. After loopholes I figured out ON MY OWN, I finally now have gotten access to view these loans to find out I have multiple late payments Edfinancial didnt make much an effort to reach out and notify me about., I contacted Edfinancial about my federal student loan and {$12000.00} capitalized interest added to my overall balance due to XXXX ( previous ) loan servicer transferring my student loan over to Edfinancial via forbearance. Also I have received conflicting information about the number of payments made to public service loan forgiveness from both edfinancial and studentaid.gov. I graduated from school in 2017 and have been making on time payments in full since and now my balance is increasing due to mismanagement and inaccurate accounting on part of loan services. Also my credit score has went down because of this poor mismanagement]</td>\n",

At the time the delinquency was reported, my loans were in forbearance, and there was no clear communication from XXXX  that auto-debit payments would not resume once the forbearance ended. Additionally, I was unable to access my EdFinancial accountmy account number was not recognizedand when I received correspondence by mail, I reasonably assumed it was fraudulent due to the lack of matching account records. \\n\\nI also never received any XXXX or XXXX late notices, which are typically issued before a XXXX delinquency is reported. This delinquency appeared suddenly on my credit report without adequate warning or progressive reporting. The loan has since been paid in full, and I had a clean payment history dating back to 2008 prior to this issue. \\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, furnishers of credit information are required to ensure that all information reported to credit agencies is accurate and complete. I believe EdFinancial has violated this standard and am requesting that the delinquency be removed from my credit report., FAFSA did not inform me that EdFinancial had been designated as my loan servicer. Additionally, EdFinancial failed to notify me by mail or any other means that they had assumed responsibility for servicing my loans. Unlike my previous loan servicers, XXXX XXXX and XXXX who promptly sent formal written notices upon assignment, EdFinancial provided no such communication.\\n\\nAs a result, I was unaware of their involvement until they reported XXXX missed payments directly to the credit bureauwithout giving me prior notice or an opportunity to address the issue. This lack of communication and transparency is a serious departure from standard industry practices and has caused significant harm to my credit standing., I am writing to formally continue my dispute the delinquency reported on my student loan account dated XX/XX/year&gt;, and to raise serious concerns regarding mishandling of my Income-Driven Repayment ( IDR ) and Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) applications currently in process. \\n\\nSummary of Issue : I submitted IDR and PSLF applications on XX/XX/year&gt;, via StudentAid.gov. \\n\\nAs of today, my XXXX XXXX confirms PSLF approval, showing XXXX out of XXXX qualifying payments. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/year&gt;, I spoke with EdFinancial rep XXXX, who confirmed my loans are on temporary hold until XX/XX/year&gt;, due to the IDR application.

In direct contradiction to this, EdFinancial added a {$90.00} charge to my accountan action that is not only unjustified but also unlawful. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX University submitted official verification of my enrollment directly to EdFinancial. I am once again attaching that documentation. In addition, I received a federal student loan disbursement as recently as XX/XX/year&gt; and have completed my exit counselingclear indicators that I am actively enrolled and compliant with federal guidelines. \\n\\nDespite this, EdFinancial continues to ignore these legally binding facts. Let me be clear : students enrolled at least half-time are entitled to deferment under the law. EdFinancials blatant disregard of this is unacceptable and appears to be a calculated attempt to force borrowers into repayment status in violation of federal policy. This is not just negligenceit mirrors the tactics of a predatory financial institution.\\n\\nI am also deeply disturbed to discover that EdFinancial has changed the login credentials for my account without my consent. This has effectively locked me out of my account, and your password reset process requires an account numberwhich, ironically, can not be retrieved without logging into the account itself. This creates a closed loop that appears deliberately designed to obstruct borrowers from managing their accounts and to increase the likelihood of default. \\n\\nWhat began as a {$90.00} error has now ballooned into a balance of {$1900.00}, despite the fact that I am still actively enrolled in college. This is not only outrageous, it borders on abuse.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that EdFinancial representatives previously expressed dissatisfaction when I declined to enter repayment while pursuing my graduate degree. Let me be clear : EdFinancial has no authority to dictate when I must repay my loans when I am eligible for deferment. The coercive tactics being employed here are unacceptable.\\n\\nI am demanding the immediate removal of all erroneous charges and a full correction of my account to reflect my lawful deferment status. If this matter is not resolved without delay, I will be filing a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and will also seek legal counsel to explore further action.\\n\\nThis continued mismanagement is not only unethical, it is illegal. I expect a response within 10 business days. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I have a student loan that is being serviced by EdFinancial Services. On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to switch from a SAVE Plan to an Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ) Plan due to litigation blocking forgiveness for borrowers signed up for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) Program. However, EdFinancial Services has not processed my application or responded to emails about status updates on my IBR Application. There has been no acknowledgment or anything of the email inquiry. \\n\\nThe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been unable to process my buyback request or PSLF Application ( which I applied for on XX/XX/XXXX ) due to EdFinancial 's inability to timely process my IBR Application since XX/XX/XXXX. I need for EdFinancial to process my IBR Application so that I can obtain qualifying payments for the PSLF Program. They had ample time before the pause in XXXX of this year to process and then had time after the pause was lifted in XXXX to process that application and they have held it up blocking me from obtaining qualifying payments. If they need to hire temps to help process these applications, that's what they should do. Or they need to modernize their computer systems to process these applications automatically without humans., Ed financial reported my student loan account as 90 day delinquent. This has caused my family and I to jeopardize our home loan that was set to close in the next 30 days. Due to EdFinancial not confirming or actively making sure they had the correct contact information to relay the information to myself that student loan payments had started again, this dropped my credit score a staggering XXXX points ruining my credit and any chances of providing for my family.

Even recently, on XX/XX/XXXX, I made a huge payment of {$1500.00}, and again, it was reversed the same day without my knowledge or notification. They even gave me a CONFIRMATION email stating that my payment was received. However, they never informed me that this was reversed. This has hugely affected my credit score as it has dropped my credit from XXXX to XXXX which is a drop of XXXX points. I have seen that Edfinancial has faced several legal cases online. This behavior is frankly predatory., FAFSA did not inform me that EdFinancial had been designated as my loan servicer. Additionally, EdFinancial failed to notify me by mail or any other means that they had assumed responsibility for servicing my loans. Unlike my previous loan servicers, XXXX XXXX and XXXX who promptly sent formal written notices upon assignment, EdFinancial provided no such communication.\\n\\nAs a result, I was unaware of their involvement until they reported XXXX missed payments directly to the credit bureauwithout giving me prior notice or an opportunity to address the issue. This lack of communication and transparency is a serious departure from standard industry practices and has caused significant harm to my credit standing., Ed financial reported my student loan account as 90 day delinquent. This has caused my family and I to jeopardize our home loan that was set to close in the next 30 days. Due to EdFinancial not confirming or actively making sure they had the correct contact information to relay the information to myself that student loan payments had started again, this dropped my credit score a staggering XXXX points ruining my credit and any chances of providing for my family. As of today I have filed disputes with the 3 credit bureaus as well as EdFinancial., I have federal student loans managed by Edfinancial Services. I have spoken with them by phone, but I still believe there are inaccuracies in my account, including the loan balance and how interest is being calculated. Despite my attempts to get clarification, my concerns have not been resolved. \\nIn addition, l 've been receiving repeated phone calls from Edfinancial. When I answer, there is silence no one speaks. I've even said things like \" please say something this time, '' and they hang up after a few seconds. This has happened multiple times. It's unsettling and feels like harassment. \\nThese calls and unresolved errors have been worsening my mental health XXXX, including XXXX  XXXX  and XXXX, for which I have XXXX  documentation. I had XXXX XXXX for test XXXX  in school and XXXX  from college XXXX  due to the impact of these conditions. This loan debt and the way it's being handled have significantly contributed to my stress. \\n\\n( Additionally XXXX XXXX DOGE team accessing my student information through accessing the department of education makes me very uneasy. this violates my FERPA and HIPAA. this is just a minor detail but id like this proven or disproven ) I am asking the CFPB to help ensure : - My account is reviewed thoroughly and corrected if there are errors. \\n- These silent or repeated calls stop. \\n- I am treated with transparency and respect moving forward. \\n- Look into every time theyve called the last couple years, and note how theyve not spoken. theyve recently reported 90 days past due without telling me i was behind and now my credit score has dropped XXXX points please remove them from my credit report and remove any negative notes on my credit, I contacted Edfinancial about my federal student loan and {$12000.00} capitalized interest added to my overall balance due to XXXX ( previous ) loan servicer transferring my student loan over to Edfinancial via forbearance. Also I have received conflicting information about the number of payments made to public service loan forgiveness from both edfinancial and studentaid.gov. I graduated from school in 2017 and have been making on time payments in full since and now my balance is increasing due to mismanagement and inaccurate accounting on part of loan services. Also my credit score has went down because of this poor mismanagement, I have XXXX loans through Edfinancial from when I attended a university for a single semester. Years later, I started getting hit with late payments on loan repayment with little to no notice. Now, my credit score has significantly dropped just before I was getting ready to get pre approved for a home, now that plan has completely derailed. I had to do extensive investigating and research just to find out I was responsible for this this loan. I have a private student loan that I have been making payments on for last couple years no issues. I thought that was my loan I owed and that was it. Edfinancial has provided me little to no notice about payments I would be responsible for this loan I didnt even realize I had. Then suddenly, my credit score tanked. When I call to inquire about this loan and issue, its next to impossible to talk to a real representative about it and nobody to assist me and answer questions I have. They are ruining my financial planning and next steps in my life Im trying to take. After loopholes I figured out ON MY OWN, I finally now have gotten access to view these loans to find out I have multiple late payments Edfinancial didnt make much an effort to reach out and notify me about., In either XXXX or XXXX of XXXX, the Federal government paused student loan repayments. Since that time, I have received no communication from EdFinancial regarding my loans or repayment status. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a series of letters in the mail ; one provided a statement, another a notification of a failed auto-payment and a third stating that my account was over 120 days late. I had no clue what these letters were and was shocked. I went to the link that the letters directed, and realized this was for EdFinancial and it wasn't a scam, seeking payment. When I logged into the account, I saw through the payment history, that they'd been attempting auto-debits since XX/XX/XXXX to an account that I had closed in XXXX. No notification had ever been sent to me to state that loans were going back into repayment. That aside, no notification has ever been sent to me to indicate that they'd been unsuccessfully attempting payment for the last 18 months. Only on XX/XX/XXXX had I received notice. I paid the late payment through my new checking account with another institution. When I spoke with an agent, she informed me that I was on electronic notification delivery. That said, not once had EdFinancial e-mailed me to say that they were attempting payment and payment had failed, or that they were even going into repayment status. Those messages sat in the EdFinancial inbox and no e-mail had ever been sent to my e-mail, which was on file with them, to indicate messages were waiting for me to read. Further, they had not sent me any letters in the mail either. They have now reported me 120 days late, even though I'm current and made myself current as soon as they actually notified me. This is incredibly deceptive and I made the late payment but if I'd been sent letter previously, as they finally did on XX/XX/XXXX, I would have addressed this before it ever went into a late status. They collected interest on me for loans that I could have already have paid off by now, if they'd only been responsible enough to reach out to me. I have received no e-mail or written letter from them in nearly 5 years and now they report me late without allowing me the opportunity to pay., The call made to Nelnet was to inquire as to how the interest worked. The rate listed in 6.5 % but I see the information below on my account and cant make sense of it : Payment Amount {$19.00}XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Principal {$11.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Applied to Interest {$8.00}, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  Applied to Fees* {$0.00} They informed to go to my loan agreement but I dont have that information, and my loan servicer they should have it, if that is how they are applying payment etc. They should know the ins and outs of my agreement. It appears predatory and secrative and not very informative as to interest calculation and when the end of my payments will be etc. \\nAll I am asking is for the amortization table to make sense of my payments etc. I get that payment is applied to interest first, but it is a lot more than 6.5 %. A car can be paid off in 6 years with more interest than this and I dont have an end date for my payments. \\n\\nI am sure I am not the only student loan holder with issues with Nelnet. Thank you for your time. Any help you can provide deeply appreciated., To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) Subject : Formal Complaint Against MOHELA for Improper Collection and Credit Reporting During Federal Pause Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a formal complaint against MOHELA regarding their handling of my federal student loan account, including attempts to collect payment during the federally mandated payment pause, improper credit reporting, and failure to provide notice of a loan servicer transfer. \\n\\nDespite the federal student loan forbearance in place at the timewhich clearly paused payments, interest, and collection activitiesMOHELA attempted to collect payment from me. This action was in direct conflict with the terms of the federal pause. Furthermore, my loan account has since been negatively reported to credit bureaus based on these improper collection attempts, causing harm to my credit standing. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, my loan was transferred from a previous servicer to MOHELA without my knowledge or consent, and I did not receive any official notification of the transfer. As a result, I was left unaware of any changes in account status or payment expectations, further complicating the situation and increasing the potential for errors and misunderstandings. \\n\\nThese actions by MOHELA appear to violate consumer protections and the terms of the federal student loan relief measures. I am requesting that the CFPB investigate this matter, ensure any inaccurate credit reporting is corrected, and hold MOHELA accountable for any non-compliant or deceptive practices. \\n\\nPlease let me know what additional documentation or information you may require from me to move forward with this complaint. \\n\\nThank you for your attention to this matter. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX il XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was notified by a 3rd party that there was a change to my credit score. It dropped XXXX points! I log in to find out why, shows it's a student loan reporting delinquent. \\nI set-up an account for this new loan servicer NelNet, and it shows as IN FORBEARANCE ( I have screenshots to verify!! ). How can you show that it's in FORBEARANCE and then suddenly with no notice show it as delinquent and drop someone's credit score by XXXX points with no notice?!! \\nA search on XXXX about this led me to find this has been suddenly happening to TONS of people with the same loan servicer!!!! \\n\\nI was not notified that this was about to happen and given time to make any needed arrangements!, I am filing a complaint against EdFinancial Services regarding the inaccurate reporting of a XXXX delinquency on my student loan account ending in XXXX. At the time the delinquency was reported, my loans were in forbearance, and there was no clear communication from XXXX  that auto-debit payments would not resume once the forbearance ended. Additionally, I was unable to access my EdFinancial accountmy account number was not recognizedand when I received correspondence by mail, I reasonably assumed it was fraudulent due to the lack of matching account records. \\n\\nI also never received any XXXX or XXXX late notices, which are typically issued before a XXXX delinquency is reported. This delinquency appeared suddenly on my credit report without adequate warning or progressive reporting. The loan has since been paid in full, and I had a clean payment history dating back to 2008 prior to this issue. \\n\\nUnder the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S. Code 1681s-2, furnishers of credit information are required to ensure that all information reported to credit agencies is accurate and complete. I believe EdFinancial has violated this standard and am requesting that the delinquency be removed from my credit report., Im reaching out because I urgently need legal help regarding what I believe to be a predatory and deceptive student loan consolidation that has dramatically inflated my original student loan debtwithout my full understanding, knowledge, or consent. \\n\\nBetween XXXX and XXXX, I attended college and borrowed a total of approximately {$6600.00} in student loans XXXX XXXX and XXXX ). These loans were later consolidated in XXXX I understood to be paid in full through that process. \\n\\nHowever, in XX/XX/XXXX, a new XXXX XXXX XXXX was created for {$23000.00}, without any formal or transparent communication with me. This debt includes significant interest and penalties I was not informed about over the years, despite believing my loans were handled through the prior consolidation. \\n\\nTo make matters worse, my loan records reflect conflicting statuses : Paid in Full through Consolidation appears multiple times for the same loans. \\n\\nA loan dated XXXX lists a disbursement of {$23000.00}, even though I have not attended school or requested a loan since the XXXX. \\n\\nI never knowingly agreed to this new consolidation, and if I did sign anything, it was under misleading or unclear circumstancespossibly connected to past bankruptcies, forbearance confusion, or default status chaos. \\n\\nThis feels like systematic deception and financial abuse, and I believe I am being taken advantage of through a system that thrives on complexity and a lack of clear borrower communication. \\n\\nI need legal help to : Challenge the legitimacy of the XXXX consolidation loan Determine whether my original loans were actually paid or resolved Assess if this situation qualifies for student loan discharge or debt relief Hold the Department of Education or loan servicers accountable for misleading or unauthorized actions I am overwhelmed, out of resources, and truly in need of an advocate who can help me fight for the truth and my rights.\\n\\nPlease let me know if this is something your office can assist with, or if you can refer me to someone who specializes in cases like mine. Thank you deeply for your time, your help, and your compassion., Student loan servicer misconduct, including errors in loan balances, misapplied payments, and wrongful denials of payment plans., My XXXX XXXX XXXX  servicer was XXXX and I had no issues and made my payments on time. Now my loans have been moved to a new servicer called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and I'm trying to make my account so I can make my payments on time as I always have and it's saying they don't have my info. I did some research on the topic and this is happening to many people across the XXXX so that you have late payments and fees and ruin your credit and have to pay even more. It's criminal and wrong., Dear CFPB, I am submitting this complaint regarding EdFinancial 's misrepresentation and mishandling of my student loan, which has resulted in financial hardship and damage to my credit. \\n\\nKey Issues : Misrepresentation of Refund Impact on Loan Forgiveness : In XX/XX/XXXX, EdFinancial explicitly told me I could request a refund of payments made during the COVID-19 forbearance period without affecting my eligibility for student loan forgiveness.\\n\\nRelying on this, I requested and received a refund of {$14000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. \\n\\nI had already fully paid off my loan in XXXX, believing my financial obligations were settled. \\n\\nI was never informed that accepting the refund would reinstate my loan balance or accrue additional interest.\\n\\nUnfair and Deceptive Practices : Despite being assured my loan forgiveness eligibility was unaffected, my balance was reinstated, now totaling {$15000.00} with added interest.\\n\\nHad I been properly informed of the consequences, I would not have proceeded with the refund.\\n\\nMishandling and Lack of Transparency : EdFinancial claimed my loan records from XXXX were lost due to a server overhaul. \\n\\nFor years, I sought clarification but was ignored. Only after I escalated my complaint to CFPB and provided bank records did EdFinancial acknowledge the issue that lead to an unsatisfactory result.\\n\\nFinancial &amp; Credit Damage : The reinstated balance and\\naccumulated interest have caused a significant financial burden and negatively impacted my credit score., Thank you for giving me a voice to express concern and frustration. For the last 15 years, I have tried DOZENS of times to dispute the amount that the student loan people have been charging me. \\n\\nI graduated college in XXXX and my wife, likewise, graduated in XXXX. Shortly thereafter, we combined our loans. In XXXX, I even went through bankruptcy and was told student loans were off-limits. I am a XXXX XXXX and have good number-sense, so in the early XXXX 's, I felt that the interest and totals I was being charged for were inaccurate. I started making calls and got nowhere. \\n\\nNot knowing the details of the law, in about XXXX, I wrote a letter asking if this was something that could be settled ( like an IRS bill ), explaining that I was nearing retirement age and may be no longer able to pay the full amount, to which I never received a reply. \\n\\nIn XXXX, my wife applied for and was approved for a XXXX discharge. After the payments were resumed, there was no lowering of the amount of our combined loan. I made several calls about this and asked for proof that my wife 's portion of the loans were actually discharged from our combined loan. \\n\\nIn XXXX, they sent me a redacted promissory note that shows all of the individual loans that were added to the combined loan, but any dates or colleges that they are tied appear to be redated. I made literally dozens of calls since that time that got nowhere. \\n\\nWhen I bought my current house in XXXX and again when I refinanced in XXXX, I even had to have the student loan people verify to the mortgage loan people that my loans were in dispute so that I could obtain those loans. \\n\\nAfter my loan was transferred to another servicer - YET AGAIN - I asked for proof and they sent me the same exact redacted promissory note. \\n\\nBecause of the runaround, and the multiple changes to my loan servicer over the years, it is my feeling that the student loan people have no way to actually prove the exact total of student loans, an accurate accounting of any payments I have made, an accurate accounting of interest accumulated, nor any proof that my wife 's loans were actually removed from the account. \\n\\nIn the civilian world, this would be grounds for breach of contract and voiding of the loan ( s ). I've had several lawyers tell me I have an easy case to win, but I do not have the means to do so, so I am depending on you fine folks to make this situation right. It should not be legal for the government to send me a bill for a loan that they can actually prove I owe. \\n\\nThank you for your time and effort., To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to express my growing frustration and serious concern regarding EdFinancials continued mishandling of my student loan accountdespite my repeated attempts to resolve the matter with proper documentation and through the appropriate channels.\\n\\nLast year, I submitted a formal complaint along with verified documentation confirming my continuous enrollment in school, which legally qualifies me for an in-school deferment under federal regulations. In direct contradiction to this, EdFinancial added a {$90.00} charge to my accountan action that is not only unjustified but also unlawful. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX University submitted official verification of my enrollment directly to EdFinancial. I am once again attaching that documentation. In addition, I received a federal student loan disbursement as recently as XX/XX/year&gt; and have completed my exit counselingclear indicators that I am actively enrolled and compliant with federal guidelines. \\n\\nDespite this, EdFinancial continues to ignore these legally binding facts. Let me be clear : students enrolled at least half-time are entitled to deferment under the law. EdFinancials blatant disregard of this is unacceptable and appears to be a calculated attempt to force borrowers into repayment status in violation of federal policy. This is not just negligenceit mirrors the tactics of a predatory financial institution.\\n\\nI am also deeply disturbed to discover that EdFinancial has changed the login credentials for my account without my consent. This has effectively locked me out of my account, and your password reset process requires an account numberwhich, ironically, can not be retrieved without logging into the account itself. This creates a closed loop that appears deliberately designed to obstruct borrowers from managing their accounts and to increase the likelihood of default. \\n\\nWhat began as a {$90.00} error has now ballooned into a balance of {$1900.00}, despite the fact that I am still actively enrolled in college. This is not only outrageous, it borders on abuse.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that EdFinancial representatives previously expressed dissatisfaction when I declined to enter repayment while pursuing my graduate degree. Let me be clear : EdFinancial has no authority to dictate when I must repay my loans when I am eligible for deferment. The coercive tactics being employed here are unacceptable.\\n\\nI am demanding the immediate removal of all erroneous charges and a full correction of my account to reflect my lawful deferment status. If this matter is not resolved without delay, I will be filing a formal complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and will also seek legal counsel to explore further action.\\n\\nThis continued mismanagement is not only unethical, it is illegal. I expect a response within 10 business days. \\n\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Hi, I was enrolled in the SAVE plan in 2023 for my student loans through EdFinancial Services, and because of my current income, my payments were {$0.00} per month. I was told that since my payments were {$0.00}, that I did not have to make a payment and that interest was technically accumulating, but it was being covered by the government. I now checked on my loan website again, and now it says that I owe an additional ~ $ XXXX. I called and they said that if I had made a payment of even {$1.00} per month, that the interest would have been covered, but since it was XXXX, that it was not covered. I would like to dispute this, as my student loan provider lied to me and gave me false information. Had this information been offered from the beginning, I would have tried to pay something each month. Now I owe an extra $ XXXX. I also tried to call and file a complaint and to see if I could retroactively pay or resolve this peacefully ; however, I was not allowed to speak to someone regarding the complaint, and I was unable to get a phone number or other contact information. \\n\\nThe person who I just spoke to today was helpful and his employee number is XXXX. I'm pretty sure when I called in XX/XX/year&gt; and was given this false information, they refused to give me their employee IDs, I have a student loan that is being serviced by EdFinancial Services. On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to switch from a SAVE Plan to an Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ) Plan due to litigation blocking forgiveness for borrowers signed up for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) Program. However, EdFinancial Services has not processed my application or responded to emails about status updates on my IBR Application. There has been no acknowledgment or anything of the email inquiry. \\n\\nThe XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has been unable to process my buyback request or PSLF Application ( which I applied for on XX/XX/XXXX ) due to EdFinancial 's inability to timely process my IBR Application since XX/XX/XXXX. I need for EdFinancial to process my IBR Application so that I can obtain qualifying payments for the PSLF Program. They had ample time before the pause in XXXX of this year to process and then had time after the pause was lifted in XXXX to process that application and they have held it up blocking me from obtaining qualifying payments. If they need to hire temps to help process these applications, that's what they should do. Or they need to modernize their computer systems to process these applications automatically without humans., The company NelNet did not have the correct contact information in regards to my federal student loans. They never mailed me a letter saying that the forbearance on the account has ended. Never mailed me a letter saying that payments on my account have started. Never mailed me to inform me that my account was delinquent. I only found out after checking my credit score and noticing a XXXX XXXX from 8 missed payments on 4 different loans XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not know my student loan payments were set to resume and they had the wrong contact information like email and phone number, but they did have the correct address. My account was than transferred to XXXX. I called NelNet to try to get the \" late payments '' removed from my account but said they could not do so. How am I suppose to make a payment to a company that I didn't even have an account set up for if they never reached out and contacted me about it?, Edfinancial has been contacting me at an outdated email and home address, due to this I was not made aware that my student loan repayment began and that it reached 90 day delinquency. Edfinancial 's response on page 7 of the document \" Servicers Response '' states \" Edfinancial uses a variety of commercial vendors to identify a borrower 's contact information. Vendors include the major consumer credit reporting agencies, with additional support provided by industry leaders such as XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and Electronic White Pages . Throughout the payment pause, Edfinancial placed a priority on maintaining accurate demographic information and borrower engagement. We continued skip tracing efforts when we identified that a borrower 's contact information may have become invalid. Outbound dialing jobs ran weekly to obtain updated mailing addresses. '' However, if they followed up on this statement Edificial would have been made aware through these reporting agencies that my contact information was indeed not current. Please review dispute letter provided as an attachment for further information. When reviewing my credit reports there is no indication of late payments for the months of XXXX and XXXX. My account is noted as current/conditions met. Moving to XXXX my reports reflects a 90 day delinquency or no reporting at all., Hi, on XX/XX/year&gt;, I submitted a {$6200.00} payment to Edfinancial, and today, XX/XX/year&gt;, it went from pending to not existing at all. I checked my previous payments, and it looks like they have been reversing multiple payments since XXXX or have had no proof of payments whatsoever for some months. I pay my student loans every month. If I do miss a payment ( which is rare ), I pay the interest that accrued. Due to these \" missed payments, '' my credit score went from XXXX to XXXX. \\nI had called on XX/XX/year&gt;, asking about why the most recent payment I had made was not showing up after being shown as processing for the past few days. I was told that no planned payments were showing on the representative 's end. This is odd since I had the confirmation number. A few days before, on XX/XX/year&gt;, I had called to inquire why my credit score was so low and if there was anything they could do to fix it. I was told it was a problem with my bank, and there was nothing they could do about my credit score.\\n\\nI just don't understand why it is so difficult to make a payment with this service. I pay on time, never get told that my payment has been reversed or if it even falls off the face of the Earth.]</td>\n",
              "      <td>[Our own direction of Human Resources has noted other teachers with the same issue. It appears as though that EdFinancial is deliberately trying to stall in order for borrowers to give up., Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress., Illegal Student Loan Reporting &amp; Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment I am filing a formal complaint against [ Loan Servicer Name ], XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. 2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. 3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). I demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action., I have provided documentation relating to my loan on three different occasions. The documentation relates to a {$5000.00} teacher loan forgiveness. The last documentation I provided was from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, being the third time theyve submitted paperwork showing that Ive been a certificated teacher with them since XXXX. EdFinancials form provides for only ONE entry and they wanted to know every school I worked for within the district with dates and locations. So our HR was kind enough to provide separate EdFinancial forms for each of the schools I worked at from XXXX  to present, despite that not being necessary. I once again got a rejection letter that my documents are not complete. When Ive tried to speak with them on the phone, they give me the run around and cant properly explain why their form has room for only one entry., I am devastated. I would like to report a situation with my student loans. I recently found out my loans were in default. I have never been in default with my student loans. They notified me on my email instead to mail that I was delinquent. Needless to say I had nine accounts that went 90 days past due and dropped my score over XXXX points. I have Aid Avantage and I did not know who the servicer was until I reviewed my credit report. I would like for them to remove the past due notice off of all 9 accounts. I was denied a student loan for my daughter and we dont know what we are going to do because of it. Also there have been 2 credit card closures from my credit because of this., According to Studentaid.gov, Im to get an email and a letter of notice that my servicer is being changed. studentaid.gov says that my issuer is nelnet. Nelnet says my issuer is somewhere else. With that said, the only reason i would have know would be because i am trying to make a payment. Now im going to incrue extra interest and my i have no idea where my loan is. This is ridiculous and I would really like to know where it is. Nelnet messages told me that as I logged in today XX/XX/year&gt;, but nothing else. If i incrue any late payment or interest fees, I will sue., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter.

Additionally, due to persistent issues with loan forgiveness applications, gaps in payment plans, and egregious interest accrual, you have been paying for over 20 years and now face a higher loan balance than the original amount. If you fail to pay, your Social Security payments can be garnished, which would leave you in poverty at an age when you can no longer work. To address these violations and protect your Social Security, you are formally requesting immediate discharge and withdrawal of the affected student loan, permanent removal of related loan data from credit reports, a complete audit and explanation of the data breach, and confirmation that all improperly shared records have been destroyed or secured.

My information was among that dataset that has been compromised. I have been forced into forbearance for the last several months without access and cohesive communication, intentionally misleading information, inaccessible support structure to remedy this. I have chosen a career based on the agreement for pslf and loan structure, and the loan servicer and department of education, federal government are violating agreement and conducting business in a way that is intentionally corrupt, misleading, fraudulent.

Furthermore, unauthorized access to my IRS tax data raises serious concerns regarding potential identity theft, fraud, and violations of federal data security standards. \\nGiven the severity of this breach and the direct impact on my financial security and privacy, I demand the following corrective actions : 1. Immediate discharge and cancellation of all my federal student loans due to the breach of my financial aid and tax records, which invalidates the integrity of my loan agreements. \\n2.

Under the four collections afforded to me, three are in direct violation. They are as follows : Use of information : The ED must ensure that the records are used only for the reasons given, or seek permission for other uses.The recent access by DOGE is a direct violation of this Privacy Right. \\n\\nSafeguards : The ED must provide adequate safeguards to protect the records from unauthorized access and disclosure.The recent access by DOGE is a direct violation of this Privacy Right. \\nAccess to records : Borrowers can access their records and correct any inaccuracies.The recent access by DOGE is a direct violation of this Privacy Right.\\n\\nAlthough the ED has access to student loan data, including borrowers XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ; names, Social Security numbers, financial information, and contact information, student advocacy groups and members of Congress have expressed concern about the access granted to DOGE. Additionally, as per the original complaint, I am allowed key protections under the Privacy Act and this access, without my verbal and/or written consent has caused great concern on the validity of the data showing in these accounts. \\nViolation of the Privacy Act of 1974 : The mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of my personal information contravenes federal requirements that safeguard the privacy of individuals data managed by federal agencies and contractors. \\nBreach of the Higher Education Act : The Higher Education Act requires servicers to maintain strict confidentiality and compliance in loan transfers. The transfer of my loan to XXXX and subsequent data demonstrate clear negligence. \\nBreach of Contract and Data Security Obligations : By failing to protect my sensitive information, both MOHELA and XXXX have breached contractual terms and obligations, rendering these debts unenforceable., I am submitting this complaint regarding the mismanagement of my federal student loans by AidVantage ( on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education ) and my unresolved requests for loan forgiveness or cancellation due to ongoing financial hardship. \\n\\nSince experiencing a significant reduction in income, I have repeatedly sought relief through repayment assistance, deferment, and forgiveness programs. I requested information about eligibility for loan discharge, including hardship-based cancellation and income-driven repayment plans, but I either received no response or was provided incomplete and unclear guidance. As a result, my loan balance continued to grow, adding to my financial and emotional distress.\\n\\nI also have concerns about potential FERPA violations and the mishandling of borrower data. I suspect that my student loan information may have been improperly accessed or used by third parties, including companies affiliated with XXXX XXXX, such as XXXX ( formerly XXXX ). This raises serious privacy concerns and undermines the legal protections I am entitled to under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\\n\\nI am requesting a full investigation into how my loans were managed, whether proper relief options were offered, and whether my personal information was shared without consent. I am also asking for assistance in obtaining full cancellation or discharge of this debt due to hardship and mishandling., I am disputing the validity of my federal student loan due to a major breach of my personal, educational, and financial records. \\nIt has been publicly reported that XXXX XXXX was able to access sensitive educational data across the United States, including information protected under FERPA.\\n\\nAs a result, my private information which should have been safeguarded under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) was improperly accessed and exposed without my consent. \\nThe Department of Education, loan servicers, and associated entities had a legal obligation to protect my data and failed to do so. \\nDue to this gross violation of federal law and the harm caused by the mishandling of my information, I am demanding full cancellation of my student loan debt., I am writing to formally dispute the legitimacy of my student loan obligations. Due to serious legal violations and breaches of federal privacy laws, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Privacy Act of 1974, and the Higher Education Act, I demand the immediate cancellation of all financial obligations related to these debts.\\n\\nIt has come to my attention that my personal educational and financial information has been improperly accessed by unauthorized third parties, including Elon Musk/DOGE or affilia entities. This unauthorized access constitutes a gross violation of my federal privacy rights and nullifies any enforceable loan agreements under federal law.\\n\\nLegal Grounds for Discharge : 1. FERPA Violation : The exposure of my educational records without my express written consent is a direct breach of FERPA, which mandates the protection of personally identifiable information. \\n\\n2. Violation of the Privacy Act of 1974 : The mishandling and unauthorized disclosure of my personal information contravenes federal requirements that safeguard the privacy of individuals ' data managed by federal agencies and contractors.\\n\\n3. Breach of the Higher Education Act : The Higher Education Act requires servicers to maintain strict confidentiality and compliance in loan transfers.

I also believe the loan was mishandled, with incomplete and inaccurate information provided to me, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), as well as the Higher Education Act. \\n\\nDespite contacting the company and requesting an investigation, verification of the loan, and resolution, the servicer continues to pursue collection without addressing my formal dispute., My personal private identifying Information was breached during an alleged audit performed by the support department of governmental efficiency and XXXX XXXX. this individual is not an elected or vetted or otherwise qualified federal employee and neither are the individuals working on his behalf. As of the week of XX/XX/year&gt; I can not rely on the XXXX XXXX third parties that they have given access to my information, including, but not limited to my Social Security number date of birth first middle and last name, former and current residence, employment and financial data.

              "      <td>[I am writing to formally dispute my XXXX XXXX XXXX and request a full discharge due to a serious breach of my personal and financial information. My information was compromised without my authorization, which violates multiple federal laws designed to protect student records and personal privacy. Under these circumstances, I request the immediate cancellation and discharge of my student loan debt in full, as my rights have been severely violated. Below are the key reasons for my request ; Violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) ; My student records were disclosed without my consent, violating FERPA 's strict confidentiality protections. Breach of the Privacy Act of 1974 ; My personal and financial information was improperly accessed and shared without my authorization'ating my privacy riahts under federai law. Violation of the Higher Education Act ; As a student loan borrower, my information should have been protected, but the mishandling of my data demonstrates a failure to uphold these legal protections. Breach of Contract and Negligence ; The entity responsible for safeguarding my data failed to do so, putting my financial security at risk., My personal and financial data was compromised violating FERPA. I request full cancellation of my student loan debt., My personal and financial data was compromised violating FERPA. I request full cancellation of my student loan debt., My personal and financial data was compromised violating FERPA. I request full cancellation of my student loan debt., Code 1681n and 1681o for civil damages. Nelnet, the loan servicer responsible for these accounts, is equally liable for their role in the breach. As the originating furnisher of this erroneous and contractually voided data, Nelnet must immediately cease all furnishing of student loan information related to my name and render all associated accounts as deleted and paid in full, or otherwise indicate closure in good standing with XXXX balance due. It is unlawful and unconscionable to continue enforcing repayment obligations upon a client whose contractual terms have been breached by the government and its appointed agents. As such, I owe no further amount under any condition, and the record of these accounts must reflect that accordingly. Any delay or attempt to obstruct this dispute under the guise of identity verification is hereby nullified. My government-issued identification, including the front and back of my drivers license, my social security verification, and XXXX XXXX statement showing my current address, are all included in the PDF file named XXXX XXXX XXXX' which is already uploaded to the CFPB complaint system. This document satisfies all verification standards imposed by any bureau or furnisher. Therefore, I demand that you acknowledge receipt of this dispute and cease all reporting activity related to the tradeline in question until the matter is resolved. I will pursue legal recourse in small claims court and escalate to federal jurisdiction should you ignore or inadequately address this matter. My legal team is fully prepared to pursue compensatory and punitive damages for emotional, financial, and reputational harm. You have been formally notified., This is a formal legal demand for immediate investigation and permanent deletion of all student loan accounts reported under the tradeline \" DEPT OF XXXX, '' which is NELNET, XXXX my credit report. These accounts include all loanssubsidized, unsubsidized, and Parent PLUSand their continued presence on my report constitutes an egregious violation of federal privacy statutes and consumer protection law. It has come to light through extensive reporting and insider disclosures that entities affiliated with or under the operational influence of XXXX XXXX, specifically DOGE-related ventures, gained illegal and unrestricted access to sensitive borrower data stored within Department of Education systems. This information includes the entirety of my student loan file, which is protected under longstanding federal privacy law and explicit contractual obligations governing the use, access, and safeguarding of this data. The unauthorized access to my personal and financial records constitutes a direct violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ), the Higher Education Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act, among others. In addition, the Department of Education, by failing to prevent such a breach, has defaulted on its contractual duties, materially violating the terms of agreement I entered into as a borrower. As a matter of contract law, this breach voids the contract in its entirety, rendering all outstanding balances unenforceable. The contract is no longer valid and therefore all associated reporting must cease immediately. Furthermore, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, specifically 15 U.S., I am devastated. I would like to report a situation with my student loans. I recently found out my loans were in default. I have never been in default with my student loans. They notified me on my email instead to mail that I was delinquent. Needless to say I had nine accounts that went 90 days past due and dropped my score over XXXX points. I have Aid Avantage and I did not know who the servicer was until I reviewed my credit report. I would like for them to remove the past due notice off of all 9 accounts. I was denied a student loan for my daughter and we dont know what we are going to do because of it. Also there have been 2 credit card closures from my credit because of this., Illegal Student Loan Reporting &amp; Collections Following Department of Education Abolishment I am filing a formal complaint against [ Loan Servicer Name ], XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for continued reporting and collection of student loan debt that is now legally void following the executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. 1. Illegal Credit Reporting The credit bureaus continue to report student loans that are now unverified and legally questionable due to the dissolution of the Department of Education. 2. Failure to Verify Legitimacy of Debt The loan servicer has failed to provide evidence of legal ownership, collection rights, or servicing obligations in light of the agencys abolishment. 3. Unfair and Deceptive Practices The continued collection of these debts constitutes a violation of my rights under the FCRA ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and FDCPA ( 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). I demand an immediate investigation, deletion of these accounts from my credit report, and cessation of any collection efforts by my loan servicer. If this matter is not resolved promptly, I will pursue further legal action., There has been no communication asking for clarification or income verification beyond my original submission. I am requesting : A correction of my repayment amount in accordance with my documented income ; A written explanation of how the erroneous amount was calculated ; A guarantee that no delinquency or negative credit reporting occurs while this dispute is unresolved ; An investigation into why borrowers are being billed despite applications not being processed., Since the resumption of federal loan payments I have received little to no contact last time I called they said I was in forbearance until 2040 but nothing in writing. I am having trouble logging in with my credentials and when you call for assistance there is a long wait then a disconnection once someone finally comes to the phone.lack of transparency and accountability has caused undue stress.]</td>\n",
