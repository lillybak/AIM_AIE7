        "    * Memory is more expensive than Disk\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Memory cache: ultra-low latency but volatile (lost on process restart), not shared across machines, limited capacity → easy cache fragmentation and duplicate recompute across replicas.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Disk cache: persistent and larger, but slower I/O, still node-local (each machine builds its own cache), can suffer from file lock contention and corruption if multiple workers write concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Key design often ignores model/version/prompt-template in the key; collisions or stale hits can occur after model upgrades or template tweaks.\n",

        "    * Most useful: single-machine prototyping, batch experiments, or small deployments where warm reuse is high and topology is simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Least useful: horizontally scaled services (K8s/auto-scale), multi-region, or latency-sensitive APIs where per-node caches cause duplicated spend and inconsistent hit ratios.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Production? Partially. Acceptable as a read-through L1 (in-process memory) or L2 (local disk) layer, but production usually adds a shared cache (e.g., Redis/Memcached/Cloud KV) with TTLs, metrics, and versioned keys to avoid duplicate recompute and to survive restarts.\n",

        "      * The simple agent could perform the task if it has few-shot examples and a robust prompt.\n",
        "   - Helpfulness Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
        "      * The helpful agent needs a very specific prompt to differenciate what it means to be \"before\" or \"after\" an answer in each iteration rather than relating it to the 1st iteration. That is to avoid doing the entire set of allowed iterations (by the set limit)\n",
        "      * If the main-agent cannot construct the solution exactly, or the persona, then a helpful agent may be needed.\n",
        "      * Each iteration of the helpful adds to cost both for the main agent and the helpful.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Production Considerations:**\n",
        "   - How does the helpfulness check affect latency?  \n",
        "     * The iterations take time.\n",
        "   - What are the cost implications of iterative refinement?  \n",
        "      * It drives the costs upwards both when the main agent has to generate again after it gets a \"no\" from the helpful agent and also for each iteration of the helpful agent.\n",
        "   - How would you monitor agent performance in production?  \n",
        "      * Can use LangSmith tracing in reasonable intervals and also logging info and then analyze the logs\n",

        "      * **System A — single agent**\n",
        "\n",
        "        * **Latency/Throughput:** Lower latency, higher QPS for same budget.\n",
        "        * **Bottlenecks:** Vector store, Tavily I/O, LLM.\n",
        "        * **Risks:** Cache stampedes on hot queries; head-of-line blocking without timeouts.\n",
        "        * **Mitigation:** Async I/O nodes, small per-node concurrency limits, timeouts, request coalescing.\n",
        "\n",

        "        * **Bottlenecks:** All of A **plus** judge loop.\n",
        "        * **Risks:** Faster rate-limit trips; cost/latency spikes if K isn’t bounded.\n",
        "        * **Mitigation:** Tiny/cheap judge model, strict **K** and wall-clock/token budgets, reuse retrieval/context across retries.\n",

        "      * **Common (both):**\n",

        "        * **Tiers:** L1 in-process → L2 shared KV (Redis/Memcached) → L3 object store.\n",

        "   - How would you implement rate limiting and circuit breakers?\n",
        "\n",
        "      * **Rate limiting:** Token-bucket at **per-user** and **global** levels (e.g., Redis-backed); check before each tool/LLM node; return 429 or degrade.\n",
        "      * **Circuit breakers:** Per external tool (Tavily, vector store, LLM) with `fail_max` and `reset_timeout`; on **open**, serve stale cached results or skip judge (System B) and return best draft.\n",
        "      * **Request coalescing:** Single-flight around cache misses so one worker computes while others await result.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
        "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",

        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",

THere was some inconsistency inthe returned object, with which I am still struggling to fix. So I stop here."
