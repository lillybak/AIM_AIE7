        "\n",
        "What are some limitations you can see with this caching approach? When is this most/least useful for production systems? \n",
        "\n",
        "Consider:\n",
        "- **Memory vs Disk caching trade-offs for this approach** \n",
        "    * Memory is more expensive than Disk\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Memory cache: ultra-low latency but volatile (lost on process restart), not shared across machines, limited capacity → easy cache fragmentation and duplicate recompute across replicas.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Disk cache: persistent and larger, but slower I/O, still node-local (each machine builds its own cache), can suffer from file lock contention and corruption if multiple workers write concurrently.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Key design often ignores model/version/prompt-template in the key; collisions or stale hits can occur after model upgrades or template tweaks.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Most useful: single-machine prototyping, batch experiments, or small deployments where warm reuse is high and topology is simple.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Least useful: horizontally scaled services (K8s/auto-scale), multi-region, or latency-sensitive APIs where per-node caches cause duplicated spend and inconsistent hit ratios.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Production? Partially. Acceptable as a read-through L1 (in-process memory) or L2 (local disk) layer, but production usually adds a shared cache (e.g., Redis/Memcached/Cloud KV) with TTLs, metrics, and versioned keys to avoid duplicate recompute and to survive restarts.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Cache invalidation strategies** \n",
        "    * Limitations / trade-offs (for this approach):\n",
        "\n",
        "        * If invalidation is ad-hoc (or absent), stale embeddings/LLM outputs persist after corpus updates, model upgrades, prompt changes, or policy changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Pure “forever” caching risks correctness drift; pure short TTLs erase savings.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Most useful: relatively static data and stable model/prompt versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Least useful: fast-changing content (RAG corpora with frequent ingests), A/B testing, or active prompt/model iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Production? Not by itself. Needs explicit versioning in cache keys (model_id, embedding_dim, prompt fingerprint, corpus version), TTL + LRU/LFU, optional manual busting on deploys/ingests, and metrics (hit ratio, stale rate) to be production-grade.  \n",
        "\n",
        "    * Methods: \n",
        "        * LRU (Least Recently Used) – Removes the entry that hasn’t been accessed for the longest time, assuming older data is less likely to be needed again.\n",
        "\n",
        "        * LFU (Least Frequently Used) – Removes the entry with the fewest accesses over time, favoring retention of popular items.\n",
        "\n",
        "        * FIFO (First In, First Out) – Evicts the oldest added item regardless of access frequency, simple but can remove still-hot entries.\n",
        "\n",
        "        * TTL (Time to Live) – Discards entries after a set expiration time, ensuring freshness but potentially removing still-relevant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Random – Chooses a random entry to remove, useful in high-throughput systems where tracking usage is too costly.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Concurrent access patterns**\n",
        "    * If there are several servers accessing the same cache, then we have to decide on the priority\n",
        "    * Limitations / trade-offs (for this approach):\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Local memory/disk caches don’t coordinate across workers; N identical misses can stampede the upstream API (“cache stampede”).\n",
        "\n",
        "        * Disk writes without locking can corrupt entries; memory caches can return partial values if not atomically set.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Most useful: single worker or cooperative task queues where concurrency is low.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Least useful: high-QPS, many replicas, async fan-out (parallel tools/graph branches) that converge on the same keys.\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Production? Not yet. Add request coalescing/single-flight, per-key locks, atomic set, negative caching (to avoid repeated misses), and ideally a centralized cache to prevent N× duplication. Rate limits/backoff to protect upstream LLM/embedding APIs.\n",
        "\n",

        "    *    Limitations / trade-offs (for this approach):\n",
        "     \n",

        "    *    Most useful: bounded workloads where the working set fits comfortably in memory/disk.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    *    Production? Needs more. Implement LRU/LFU + TTL, size quotas (global and per-tenant), hot/warm/cold tiers (L1 memory → L2 Redis → L3 object store), and observability (eviction counts, disk usage, hit rates) to be production-ready.\n",

        "   - Helpfulness Agent advantages/disadvantages\n",
        "      * The helpful agent needs a very specific prompt to differenciate what it means to be \"before\" or \"after\" an answer in each iteration rather than relating it to the 1st iteration. That is to avoid doing the entire set of allowed iterations (by the set limit)\n",
        "      * If the main-agent cannot construct the solution exactly, or the persona, then a helpful agent may be needed.\n",
        "      * Each iteration of the helpful adds to cost both for the main agent and the helpful.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Production Considerations:**\n",
        "   - How does the helpfulness check affect latency?  \n",
        "     * The iterations take time.\n",
        "   - What are the cost implications of iterative refinement?  \n",
        "      * It drives the costs upwards both when the main agent has to generate again after it gets a \"no\" from the helpful agent and also for each iteration of the helpful agent.\n",
        "   - How would you monitor agent performance in production?  \n",
        "      * Can use LangSmith tracing in reasonable intervals and also logging info and then analyze the logs\n",

        "      * **System A — single agent**\n",

        "        * **Bottlenecks:** Vector store, Tavily I/O, LLM.\n",
        "        * **Risks:** Cache stampedes on hot queries; head-of-line blocking without timeouts.\n",

        "**📋 Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Create a Guardrails Node**: \n",
        "   - Implement input validation (jailbreak, topic, PII detection)\n",
        "   - Implement output validation (content moderation, factuality)\n",
        "   - Handle guard failures gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Integrate with Agent Workflow**:\n",
        "   - Add guards as a pre-processing step\n",
        "   - Add guards as a post-processing step  \n",
        "   - Implement refinement loops for failed validations\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Test with Adversarial Scenarios**:\n",
        "   - Test jailbreak attempts\n",
        "   - Test off-topic queries\n",
        "   - Test inappropriate content generation\n",
        "   - Test PII leakage scenarios\n",
        "\n",
        "**🎯 Success Criteria:**\n",
        "- Agent blocks malicious inputs while allowing legitimate queries\n",
        "- Agent produces safe, factual, on-topic responses\n",
        "- System gracefully handles edge cases and provides helpful error messages\n",
        "- Performance remains acceptable with guard overhead\n",
        "\n",
        "**💡 Implementation Hints:**\n",
        "- Use LangGraph's conditional routing for guard decisions\n",
        "- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous guard validation\n",
        "- Add comprehensive logging for security monitoring\n",
