Perfect! Now I have a complete overview of the notebook structure. Let me create a comprehensive summary of all the activities and questions you need to complete.

## 📋 **Complete Task Inventory for the LangGraph Assignment**

Based on my analysis of the notebook, here are **ALL** the activities and questions you need to complete:

### **🤝 Breakout Room #1 - Core Agent Building**

**🏗️ Activity #1** (Cell 9):
- **Task**: Add tools to the toolbelt 
- **What to do**: The code is already provided, but you may need to explain what each tool does
- **Location**: After "Creating our Tool Belt" section

**❓ Question #1** (Cell 15):
- **Question**: "How does the model determine which tool to use?"
- **What to do**: Add `##### ✅ Answer:` and explain the tool selection mechanism

**❓ Question #2** (Cell after graph creation):
- **Question**: "Is there any specific limit to how many times we can cycle? If not, how could we impose a limit to the number of cycles?"
- **What to do**: Add `##### ✅ Answer:` and explain cycle limits

**🏗️ Activity #2** (After first agent run):
- **Task**: "Please write out the steps the agent took to arrive at the correct answer"
- **What to do**: Document the agent's execution flow step by step

### **🤝 Breakout Room #2 - Evaluation & Advanced Features**

**🏗️ Activity #3** (Cell 48):
- **Task**: "Please create a dataset in the above format with at least 5 questions"
- **What to do**: Create your own evaluation dataset following the provided format

**❓ Question #3** (Cell 51):
- **Question**: "How are the correct answers associated with the questions? NOTE: Feel free to indicate if this is problematic or not"
- **What to do**: Add `##### ✅ Answer:` and explain the answer association mechanism

**❓ Question #4** (Cell 54):
- **Question**: "What are some ways you could improve this metric as-is? NOTE: Alternatively you can suggest where gaps exist in this method."
- **What to do**: Add `##### ✅ Answer:` and suggest improvements to the evaluation metric

**🏗️ Activity #4** (Cell 70):
- **Task**: "Please write what is happening in our `tool_call_or_helpful` function!"
- **What to do**: Add `##### ✅ Answer:` and explain the function's logic

**🏗️ Activity #5** (Cell 63):
- **Task**: "Please write markdown for the following cells to explain what each is doing"
- **What to do**: Replace all "##### YOUR MARKDOWN HERE" cells (Cells 64, 66, 68, 71, 73, 75, 77) with explanations of what each code cell does

### **📊 Summary Count**
- **Total Activities**: 5 (Activity #1, #2, #3, #4, #5)
- **Total Questions**: 4 (Question #1, #2, #3, #4)
- **Markdown Replacements**: 7 cells (for Activity #5)
- **Grand Total**: 16 places where you need to add content

### **🎯 Key Areas to Focus On**
1. **Tool selection mechanism** - How the LLM chooses which tool to use
2. **Agent execution flow** - Step-by-step breakdown of agent reasoning
3. **Evaluation dataset creation** - Creating meaningful test cases
4. **Helpfulness function logic** - Understanding the loop control mechanism
5. **Code explanations** - Clear descriptions of what each graph component does

### **💡 Pro Tips for Success**
- Run each code cell incrementally to understand the flow
- Keep your answers concise but complete
- Test your agent with different queries to understand its behavior
- Pay attention to the LangSmith evaluation results
- Make sure your helpfulness check prevents infinite loops
