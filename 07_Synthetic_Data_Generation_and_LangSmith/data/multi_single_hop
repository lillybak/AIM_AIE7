MultiHopAbstractQuerySynthesizer would generate:
"How have scientific theories on relativity evolved since Einstein's original publication?"
Requires interpretation and synthesis across multiple sources
Needs analytical reasoning about evolution of ideas
vs. MultiHopSpecificQuerySynthesizer:
"Which scientist influenced Einstein's work on relativity, and what theory did they propose?"
Requires specific facts from multiple sources
More straightforward factual connection
The key distinction is that Abstract queries challenge systems to provide broader, interpretive analyses rather than just factual combinations.

iâœ… Corrected:
"broad, interpretive queries"
"synthesizing them"
Why These Corrections Matter:
1. Abstract vs. Specific:
Abstract queries require interpretive, analytical responses rather than simple fact retrieval
Specific queries focus on concrete, factual answers
2. Synthesizing vs. Summarizing:
Synthesizing: Combining information from multiple sources to create new insights, interpretations, or comprehensive understanding
Summarizing: Simply condensing information without necessarily creating new analytical insights
