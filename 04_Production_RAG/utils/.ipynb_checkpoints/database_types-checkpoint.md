Vector Libraries:
Focus: Efficient similarity search and vector clustering.
Data Handling: Primarily designed to store and index vector embeddings.
Scalability: Generally limited, more suitable for smaller datasets or prototyping.
Updates: Indexes are often immutable, meaning you typically need to rebuild the index to make changes.
Functionality: Offer functionalities like vector storage, indexing, and querying using various algorithms.
Examples: Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search), Annoy, HNSWlib. 
Vector Databases:
Focus: Managing vector embeddings and providing comprehensive database functionalities.
Data Handling: Can store both vector embeddings and the associated objects they were generated from.
Scalability: Built for large-scale, real-time applications, often handling millions or billions of vectors.
Updates: Provide CRUD (create, read, update, delete) support, allowing for dynamic data changes.
Functionality: Offer features like metadata filtering, distributed storage, security, and complex querying.
Examples: Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, Qdrant. 
Analogy:
Think of it like this:
Vector Library: A specialized calculator that performs complex vector operations efficiently.
Vector Database: A full-fledged data management system with the specialized calculator built-in, along with features for data storage, organization, and more. 
Conclusion:
While both vector libraries and vector databases involve vector embeddings and similarity search, a vector database is a more comprehensive solution designed for managing and querying large-scale vector data in production environments, offering features beyond just vector operations. A vector library is more suitable for smaller-scale tasks or prototyping.
